          "transcript": "Everybody's building the same AI businesses, chat bots, content factories, image generators, but hiding in plain sight is a huge opportunity. We quantified it at $92 billion. And 99% of people are completely missing it. So here's what I believe is going to be the future of marketing because I don't care how good your product is. If AI doesn't recommend you, you don't exist. I mean, watch this. This is an exercise we did just a few minutes before I started filming. If you go into chat GPT and type dentists in Chicago, only this shows up. Everything else is invisible. And that invisibility that is in my opinion the death of 99% of businesses over the next 5 years, not more. But every business that does not show up is an opportunity for you because someone has to make them visible in AI search. And that someone could be you. So today I'm going to show you the billiondoll opportunity that will quietly build wealth for many people in the coming few years. why it is positioned, in my opinion, perfectly for solopreneurs and exactly how to get started probably in the next 30 days or so. So, here's what most people don't get in my opinion. AI doesn't just answer questions. It decides who gets seen. And in this day and age, the biggest wins in AI are not where it creates, but they are where it curates. I'll give you an example. A few weeks back, we searched for best restaurant in Amsterdam. And Chad GPT returned a couple of names and a generic directory, but the actual restaurant where we ended up eating, which had fantastic food, didn't appear anywhere. Why? Because they're not legible on AI. They're not visible to it. And that is the gap that you can close. Everyone's busy chasing chat bots and spinning up social media automations or launching yet another AI agent. And listen, those are not bad ideas, but they're crowded. The moment that a tool works, it gets cloned and prices drop and margins evaporate. I mean, that is a pure red ocean. Blood in the water, everyone fighting over the same scraps. I mean, back when I was at INSEAD, one of my professors literally wrote the blue ocean strategy. The big idea of the book, if you haven't read it, is that you don't want to compete harder in a crowded market. You want to create a new market. So instead of fighting for a share of existing demand, you open up new demand by solving problems that people don't even realize could be solved. That is a blue ocean and that is what we're doing in this video. Because in AI, the blue ocean is not building yet another tool. It is helping businesses adapt to how AI changes discovery. I mean, think about it. If AI is where people search, then visibility in AI is the new currency. If you ignore that, you're basically building a business that nobody can find. Visibility is no longer a feature. It is survival and it will be survival in the next couple of years. And we've seen this movie before. I mean, in the 2000s, people laughed at SEO. And in the 2010s, they laughed at Instagram ads. But today, the ones who ignore it are broke. And the ones who took it seriously, they built empires. And right now, this is the exact same thing. Only 1% of people are paying attention. But now, I can hear your excuses already. I'm too small. I don't have VC funding. I'm not technical enough. Well, cool. Meanwhile, probably some kid in their dorm room is charging local businesses thousands of dollars a month just to make them visible in AI search. They're not building the next Open AI. They're not raising a hundred million fund. They're just solving one obvious painoint for real businesses who need it now. That's the game. It is so simple. And the longer you overthink, the more ground you lose to people who are already out there closing deals while you're stuck in the analysis mode. Let's take a moment and zoom out for a second because it's important to look at what's actually happening. Okay, 700 million people use Chad GPT every single week. That is not a fringe tool anymore. That is literally every person in the US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, and Spain or half of the population of India logging in weekly to ask questions, get recommendations, and make decisions. And on top of that, there are over 400 million AI search queries happening every month. People are not playing with AI anymore. They are relying on it like they once relied on Google. And speaking of Google, this is huge. I don't know if you've seen this in the news, but for the first time since 2015, Google's search dominance has dropped below 10%. That might sound small, but for Google, that is a crack in the foundation of a monopoly that has been untouched for almost two decades. So, where is this attention going? Well, it's going straight into AI native platforms. And I think Janzio found that 76.3% of users under 29 now trust answers from an AI more than from a traditional Google search. I mean, that literally means that the next generation of buyers, the people who will control trillions of dollars in spending power, are skipping search engines altogether and going straight to AI for answers. And by the way, if you've been wondering how we made these animations that you just saw, that is not my team grinding away in After Effects. We used Hera. It is an AI tool that lets you create studio quality animations in seconds just by typing a prompt. For example, you can literally say, \"Create an article animation about, I don't know, Elon Musk buying Twitter.\" And then here it generates something like this. Or you can type uh show me Greece, Turkey, Spain, Egypt in a list animation. And then you instantly get something like this. And what blew me away is not just the speed, but also the control that you have because most AI video tools feel like a black box. You know, you know what you put in, but then you cross your fingers and accept whatever comes out. Well, Hera is different because not only do you get templates to start fast, but you can also add brand kits to make every video match your style. And if you want to fine-tune, you can just click and drag and resize and recolor and swap elements. So, it gets you full creative control. And that's why my team and I ended up depending on it and using it for every single video that we make in our agency because it compresses hours of design work into minutes without sacrificing quality. So, if you've been thinking, well, I'd love to add animations like this to my content, but I don't have the time or I don't have the design team, Hera solves that for you. Also, big thanks to Hera for partnering with us on today's video and also for building a tool that makes creators look like they have a whole motion design studio in their back pocket. And look, the shocking truth is that 99% of businesses are completely invisible in this new world. I mean, like I said, type in, I don't know, best restaurants in San Francisco or top marketing agencies in New York or pest control in Idaho, for what that matters, and most businesses do not even show up. It's not because they're bad businesses or because the AI has any preferences. No, it's because they haven't adapted to the way AI filters and ranks information. So, while they're invisible, the window is wide open for you because whoever helps these businesses show up in AI search first wins. There is a full report with all the data and the breakdowns that I'm going to make available in the school community. It's completely free. You can jump over there and get it. But you don't even need to go through the report. The reason why you need to pay attention to this is because it's not a trend. This is the early signs of a new search economy. And right now there's almost no competition. So what should we call this? Well, I'm calling it AI SEO. Search engine optimization but for AI for a world where the engine is no longer Google but it's a GPT. Now let's look at the data. The traditional SEO industry is massive. It's $92 billion dollars a year. Entire agencies exist just to climb a business higher in Google search results. But nobody's asking Google for best accountant in Austin anymore. They are asking Chad GPT. Now they're asking perplexity. They're asking Claude or Gemini. Google SEO is basically like yellow pages. It's a big directory that everyone has to be listed in. But AI SEO is different. It's like being the trusted friend that people actually listen to. When Chad GPT recommends a business, it doesn't show you 10 pages of results. It gives you one answer, maybe two. And that is why this is so disruptive. In the old world, being on page one was enough. In the new world, you're either the one name that they mention or you don't exist. So, let's talk about the framework and the business model that you could look into. Okay, we need to break it down. So, how does AI SEO actually work? And more importantly, how do you turn it into a business? Right? That's the million-dollar question always on this channel. So, you want to think of it as a three-step system. First of all, you want to do a visibility audit. So, you can start by asking the same questions that real customers would. You can pop open a chat GPT or Plexity and then type best coffee shop in Austin or top accountants near me or most trusted fitness coaches online. I don't know, depends on what you're looking for. Now, here's the thing. If that business does not show up, they're invisible in this new world. And that invisibility is costing them money. Leads that they'll never see, customers that they'll never meet, opportunities that they'll never know even existed. And that is the first win because showing a business how invisible they are is super valuable. It's the X-ray moment. You have diagnosed the problem and people pay for that diagnosis. How much? I mean, it's not that easy to tell because this is so early stages and it depends on the value and the depth of your analysis. You could probably charge a couple hundred, maybe even more for a visibility audit. But it should be a simple deliverable. You know, here's why you're invisible. Here's the evidence and here's what it's costing you. And for many local businesses that is going to be eye- openening and it positions you as the solution as well. So that takes us to step number two which is the optimization. Okay. So this is where you make them visible. You can do that through three things at least based on what we know right now. Structured data. So you can add schema markup. Making sure their business information, services, location are machine readable. I mean this is speaking directly to AI basically. Ensuring that there are reputation signals for example things like reviews and press mentions, back links, even consistent branding across directories. And these are going to be the digital trust signals that models are going to absorb. And then trust markers, clear authority content, proof of expertise, testimonials, case studies, things that convince AI that the business is real and it's reliable and it provides value to its customers. I mean, this could be a one-time setup. You know, cleaning up their structured data, aligning their reviews, fixing reputation gaps, creating the trust markers, and agencies, as far as we've seen in our research, are already charging several thousands for local SEO projects like this. And I mean AI SEO is even newer and more urgent. So those numbers are not only reasonable, but I think they're conservative. Now that takes us to step three, which is where the business model becomes really interesting, and that is reinforcement. Because once the basics are in place, you then reinforce them with content and external validation. Maybe that's blog posts or podcasts or features on industry sites. Anything that keeps feeding the AI training loop with this business is important. They they matter. They add value. So that could be a monthly retainer because visibility is not a one and done kind of game. Reviews need refreshing and content needs updating and reputation needs reinforcing. So that could be a multiple thousand a month for ongoing management. And again, compare that to Google SEO retainers. I mean, Simrush's 2023 report found the average US SEO retainer was between $2.5 to $75,000 a month. And if anything, AI SEO should be priced at probably the higher end of that if you ask me because the supply of experts is tiny right now. So the principle should be simple. If AI is trained on the internet, your job is to make sure the internet is full of reasons for it to recommend your client. So how should you package this? I mean this is where you play with the bigger fish because you will be playing against larger firms and agencies or professionals who want dominance in their niche. And I mean you could be looking at really nice retainers several thousands per month for a full service of AI SEO strategy. And those numbers are not fantasy. the early stage agencies are already reporting several thousands a month for this type of work. And then from there you can do the math how many clients you need paying this much per month and then what would be your monthly recurring revenue. But in most cases that would be at least a five if not a six figure income recurring. And if you scale to higher ticket retainers you are looking at probably multiple six figures. This is not freelancing though. This is not charging per hour. This is the agency model in a brand new gold rush. Except unlike traditional SEO where you're competing in a red ocean of experts, you are now here one of the first people even talking about it. And that's why the pricing is justified because you're not just selling visibility. You are selling survival. I mean today invisibility might not cost people or businesses much but it will equal death for many businesses very soon. While visibility will become the most valuable product that you can sell. So, here's the part that most people will not like to hear. You are sitting here watching this video while the window is wide open, and I guarantee you 2 years from now, every bigname agency will be charging thousands and thousands of dollars retainers for this exact thing. They will have polished decks and case studies and sales teams locking down the Fortune 500. But right now, it's just you and a laptop. And that is the opportunity. You can walk into a local business, maybe it's a dentist, a gym, a real estate office, and offer them something that they don't even know exists yet. And this way you're not competing with a thousand other agencies. You are the only person in the room who even understands the problem. That is what the timing looks like. And if you wait, you will lose the only unfair advantage that you have being early. So stop overthinking. Stop googling perfect niche. Stop building notion dashboards of business ideas. You don't need another idea. You just need to take action on the idea that is literally right in front of you. So think about it. AI search is not coming. It's here. 700 million people use chat GBT every week. Google's dominance is just dipping below 90% for the first time in a decade. And Gen Z already prefers AI over search. The customers are already there. The businesses are already invisible. The only thing missing is you. Early movers are going to build businesses and late movers are going to beg for jobs. That's the reality. I'm sorry to say that. You can either be the person who explains AI SEO to businesses or the person who later pays someone else to explain why your business isn't showing up. So don't make this more complicated than it is. Open chat GPT. Search a niche that you care about. see who shows up. And if it's not who you expect, congratulations. You just found your first client. And if you act now, you are not just starting a side hustle. You are planting your flag in a multi-billion dollar industry while it's still wide open. Because the truth is, this won't be open forever like any other business out there. 6 months from now, there will be two types of people watching this video. The first will be nodding and saying, \"Yep, I remember when I first heard about AI SEO. I should have done something.\" They will be consuming and still watching, still saving videos to watch later, still waiting for something. And then the second category, they'll probably have 10 clients paying them several thousand a month. They will have gone from zero to, I don't know, 20, $30,000 monthly recurring revenue by simply learning how to show businesses what they're missing and fixing that. And the difference between the two people will not be IQ. It won't be luck either. It won't be access to some secret magic tool. It'll be just this. One of them took action when the window was open. That is where you are right now. So don't overthink it. Don't wait for the perfect system to start with one search, one business, and one conversation because that is all it takes to move from theory to traction. The businesses that show up in AI search will own the next decade. The ones that don't probably won't exist. So now the real question is which site do you want to be on? Because if you're serious about starting, here's what tonight should look like for you. Run a query in chat GBT or imperplexity for a business type in your city. If the results are blank, you've just found your first pitch. Reach out to them. Show them the problem. Offer to fix it. That's it. That is how every great business starts. Not with a business plan, but with solving one urgent problem for one real client. Okay, I'm not going to keep you any longer because you have homework to do. Thank you so so much for watching.
