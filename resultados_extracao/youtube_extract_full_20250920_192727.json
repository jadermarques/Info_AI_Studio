          "transcript": " Asse qualquer multimilionário e eles diriam que o primeiro milhão é fácil,  mas é o primeiro 100 milhão que é a parte mais difícil.  Então, nesse vídeo, eu vou deixar o processo completo  para qualquer iniciante que vem para a A.I. para poder ir de 0 a 100 milhão.  E os 5 desafios quentes que você vai fazer alongo o caminho  e a solução para cada desses robôs diferentes.  Miquelo, cara, é muito legal ver.  Eu estou tão animado a ir para isso, porque o 0 a 100k é o que todo mundo está fazendo agora.  E você está recentemente passando pelo processo,  então, vamos fazer os 5 desafios quentes que você tem entre aqui e lá.  E você tem um monte de força.  Se você não conhece o Miquelo, ele está assustando.  Eu estava assistindo a sua história por um tempo agora.  Eu vim por meu acelerador.  E ele está indo de força a força.  O jeito que ele está fazendo as contas no LinkedIn,  o jeito que ele está assustando a outra estratégia,  ele se aproxima de aprender as habilidades,  onde ele está realmente bem jovem também.  Então, o Miquelo é muito legal estar aqui,  e eu não posso esperar para que você tenha o que você tem que fazer com esses cara.  Se você só quer dar um pouco de framing para o seu caminho  e como você sorta de vir para a realização de um monte de coisas antes de vir.  Então, o que você vê aqui na escra é a rota a 100k  e todos os problemas que eu tinha que ir por along the way.  E eu abriu-los para os 5 desafios quentes,  os 5 desafios quentes que eu tinha que ir para chegar a 100k.  Porque é um dos seus mais importantes desafios,  ao menos para mim,  para então poder ir em diferentes direções.  Mas eu senti que essa é a cobertura.  Principalmente, a maioria das pessoas irão realmente  ir para construir uma agência de ação e tal.  Sim, claro.  Eu acho que essas são as coisas exácticas.  Eu tenho que responder de novo e de novo e de novo em contato.  E vai ser tão ótimo para as pessoas ver esse contextualizamento  de basicamente ter feito o playbook  que eu já estou escrimindo com todos para fazer por tão longa.  E você está dando, eu vejo as escrituras actuales  das mensagens que você sentiu e os exemplos do posto que você está fazendo.  Então, eu estou super, super animado para acessar.  Tudo bem, o primeiro aqui é realmente apenas aprender AI.  Então, esse é o primeiro moço.  Quando você entende todo o espaço,  eu sinto que isso é onde você fica o mais overwhelmado,  porque você pode introduzir todos os diferentes tools que estão lá fora.  Em este caso, para mim,  eu estava introduzido para o Vaapi, Voiceflow, Make.com, Lovable.  E, de novo, você era um dos youtubers que eu estava assistindo no time,  porque você estava introduzindo todos os diferentes tools  e você estava falando sobre o modelo de A.I. Automation Agency.  E eu estava muito, muito emocionante.  E quando eu acessava para a A.I.,  que é onde eu realmente começou a carregar,  eu estava introduzido para todos os diferentes tools.  E eu estava muito overwhelmado,  porque há tantas coisas muito diferentes para se concentrar.  E eu não realmente sabia o que fazer a partir disso.  E isso foi...  E você estava todo o tempo.  Exatamente.  E isso foi...  Eu acho que o foco é uma das coisas mais difíceis para ter,  especialmente no espaço,  porque há tantas coisas que você pode fazer,  tantas coisas que você pode se concentrar.  Então, para mim, isso foi um...  Isso foi um passo importante que eu tinha que ir.  Então, o que eu fiz, para mim,  eu actually spent a quelques semanas  procurando cada software,  para entender mais sobre o espaço,  mas também o que cada software fez,  e a função que foi feita  sobre como construir um negócio com isso.  E depois, através do KC,  que é um dos sucesso-managers da AAA,  ele me disse que você justiça  e se concentra em uma coisa,  e isso foi o Make.com, no caso de A.I. Automation Agency.  E isso foi a coisa que eu decidi para ir para a A.I. Automation Agency.  Rimbaud, eu fiz um vídeo, eu acho que foi no...  No final de...  No meio de 2024 ou algo.  E foi de 5 diferentes formas de começar a A.I. Automation Agency.  E foi basicamente a mesma coisa.  Há esses diferentes áreas que você pode especializar.  E há um agente de voz,  que dizia que você poderia ir até o Zappia Ecosystem  e ficar muito bem com isso.  Você poderia fazer a parte de trabalho,  ou você poderia fazer os agentes de voz no texto  e os chatbots.  E eu acho que isso foi muito, muito ajudante  para muita gente,  no mesmo jeito que você está aqui.  É só cortar o nois  e pegar uma área,  porque eles são todos...  Se você só se concentra em agentes de voz,  você pode ficar muito bem com eles,  e tem muito dinheiro para ser criado em esse espaço.  Agora, como com o trabalho de automação,  ou se você quer fazer...  Eu acho que o software custom  e o 5-coding 1  são um ótimo caminho para se encontrar agora.  Então,  gravando isso,  eu acho que você precisa de uma agência general  e poder fazer tudo,  para ser tipo,  esse é o meu área de expertise  e eu posso aprender isso,  que é tão importante para os beginners.  100%.  E é tão fácil  para você só se concentrar em todos eles.  Porque você só está perdendo a oportunidade  se você não se concentra em todos eles,  mas só se concentrar em cada um,  que é exatamente o que eu senti,  porque eu estava aprendendo tudo,  especialmente tudo.  A coisa interessante sobre automações de trabalho,  é que eu acho que é meio como a skill meta,  porque você usa tudo.  Então, mesmo se você está construindo agentes de texto,  você ainda pode estar orchestrando isso  com o que o platform de trabalho  pode fazer,  ou se você está fazendo agentes de voz,  pode estar fazendo os seus atos  em algo como o Make,  ou você pode estar fazendo isso em N810  e com a mesma skill transferida.  Então,  eu acho que a base de automação de trabalho  é muito, muito solidar.  100%.  Especialmente como alguém  que não veio com conhecimento técnico,  eu acho que a skill fundamental aqui é APIs,  entendendo como as apps se transformam em um outro,  e a skill que você aprende é não o Make.com,  é a automação de trabalho.  E isso é algo que você usa para o todo o bordo.  E entendendo como as conversas do software  se transformam em um outro,  a API é a cor do todo o que nós fazemos hoje em dia,  até mesmo se você está colocando um software acessível,  é tipo,  ok, eu tenho esse legal look em frente,  como eu vou conseguir fazer nada?  Ok, eu entendo que  as automações que eu tenho que ver  no API requerceram,  então talvez eu possa  ter algum automação de trabalho  ou algum...  algum tool que eu coloquei,  e depois cogei para o API,  é tipo, tudo é construído no topo da habilidade.  100%.  Eu acho que isso é algo que você aprende over-time,  tipo, o que as habilidades fundamentais que você precisa aprender,  mas isso foi muito, muito importante para mim.  Então, o que eu fiz,  basicamente, é justiça-lo,  o quanto possível.  A automação AI é já feita no AI,  então feita para um subsecso de automação AI,  que é o trabalho de automações,  e para poder aprender esses tools,  as pessoas sobrecomplicam isso,  elas precisam de um curso,  elas precisam de algum software fantástico  para ir lá e aprender esses tools,  mas o que eu aprendi é que o YouTube é o melhor lugar  para aprender todos esses softwares e coisas.  Agora, também, há muito desse conteúdo no YouTube.  Agora, a quantidade de conteúdo de automação AI,  eu coloquei todos os cursos aqui no canal,  basicamente, tudo,  agens AI, automações AI,  e coding VIP, e todas essas coisas.  Eu tenho todos os cursos,  e esses cursos que são especializados  em todos esses funerios também.  Então, se eu não tiver o dinheiro para começar,  isso não é uma desculpa.  100%.  100%.  Especialmente para mim,  porque eu, pelo menos, ela tinha zero dólares,  e, pelo menos, quando eu coloquei o acelerador,  eu não tinha dinheiro,  eu pedi a minha irmã para me dar 80% do que ela tinha,  e eu coloquei isso também,  e eu coloquei tudo para o acelerador,  e eu fui para o...  Tudo.  Tudo e tudo.  E isso foi o clima para mim.  E a coisa que me ensinou a começar,  foi os seus vídeos de chat,  que você postou de chat, de voiz e de voiz.  Então, foi uma coisa...  Eu encontrei no YouTube também,  que você pode simplesmente aprender  e ir direto.  Então, o segundo passo aqui,  depois de aprender AI e começar,  quando você sabe,  você se enche dentro do espaço de automação AI,  você sabe que você trabalha para automações,  então, é sobre como você vai pegar o primeiro cliente,  clientes, certo?  E, para mim,  na iniciativa,  foi só trabalhar para liberdade,  para o primeiro 3 clientes,  antes de actually prestar algum cliente,  antes de perguntar para dinheiro.  E, para mim, é só porque  da experiência que eu queria ter,  mas também para ir para o momento,  eu senti que, antes,  você quer algumas quick wins,  você quer algo para manter você indo,  porque isso te motiva, e assim.  Sim, 100%.  Eu acho que a estratégia freia.  Eu entendo em um pouco de situação difícil,  com algumas pessoas,  obviamente, você é jovem,  você tem um tempo na sua mão,  você tem energia,  e você quer fazer os fundamentos  e aprender da raiva.  E, no outro lado do espaço de automação AI,  ou as pessoas querem ir para os negócios AI,  são pessoas com trabalhos,  e elas querem fazer isso como um sítio,  e elas querem vir,  e não necessariamente fazer todo o trabalho,  e ter uma base solidária,  então, é sempre um pouco trícola,  com pessoas mais jovens,  como o Arsenal,  ou as pessoas que estão a tempo rica,  definitivamente fazendo  todos os fundamentos,  e depois, trabalhando na sua maneira  para liberar clientes para pagar clientes,  é apenas uma progressão logística.  Mas algumas pessoas,  queiram e dizem,  eu não quero fazer tudo isso,  eu prefiro ser o connecador,  ser o mercado,  e isso é possível,  mas isso é definitivamente,  100% da maneira garantida,  eu chamo de,  o caminho para a raiva do AI,  é fazer esse caminho,  aprender os fundamentos,  e você vai absolutamente ficar lá,  mas não pode ser tão rápido,  como você esperava,  porque você tem que ir para os clientes  para liberar clientes para pagar seus pratos,  o que é exatamente o que você fez.  É só fazer os unscaláveis  antes de você escalar,  e, para mim,  há 19 anos,  há muito tempo,  como você mencionou,  sem responsabilidades.  Eu falto de 45 anos,  tentando entrar no espaço,  e eu entendo o ponto de vista,  quando eu falo que não quero ir para a raiva,  porque eles têm algo a perder,  eles têm o resultado,  então isso faz sentido,  mas eu senti que isso ainda é o primeiro passo,  apenas para ter experiência,  para ter o momento de ir.  Eu acessava o e-mail  que eu acessava para o meu primeiro prospecto,  que era um cara que eu sabia  de uma agência que eu trabalhei com,  eu só disse,  eu vou fazer isso.  Eu só queria ajudar vocês,  pode me ajudar com o call?  Eu estava com certeza.  E isso foi cinco dias depois,  seis dias depois que eu vi seus vídeos,  o primeiro vídeo em automação,  e eu estava tipo,  ok, isso é tão sério,  deixa eu fazer isso,  deixa eu justiar o vídeo.  Eu estava movendo.  Eu não sabia nada,  eu não sabia nada do que era,  só senti o mensagem,  porque...  E essas são outras mensagens também.  E a web network é liga,  a coisa que eu realmente emphasize em isso,  é só chegar ou maximizar  o seu contacto.  Então, vá para o seu contacto  e justa mensagem a cada pessoa que você sabe,  e eu era 19, by the way,  quando alguém me falou isso  para mostrar para o meu web network,  eu estava tipo,  o primeiro objetivo que eu tinha  foi, eu sei,  eu sei,  não tenho amigos,  eu sou o meu,  tenho amigos,  eu tenho amigos,  sou o meu,  e quando você diga em breve,  você encontra que seu irmão,  o boss,  é o restaurante,  e seu irmão,  os amigos,  o pai, é outro vizinho,  e você vai lá.  Isso é tão importante agora,  e eu tenho que  responder as mesmas perguntas também,  mas eu não conheço ninguém,  eu digo,  você precisa de seus primeiros clientes  para mais conhecimentos.  Se você justiar as pessoas  ao seu lado,  e você faça nois  e deixa as pessoas saber,  há pessoas no seu web network,  que não são,  eles também precisam,  então você tem suas primeiras conexões,  e em este caso,  é tipo,  alguém que você sabe alguém,  então, aqui você tem,  tipo, as suas,  as suas mesmas conexões,  as suas mesmas conexões,  certo?  Então, isso é uma conexão de segundo nível,  então, ao invés de dizer,  eu só conheço young people,  ou estudantes,  e nenhuma da minha família tem um businesses,  é tipo,  quem sabe?  Asse-se,  Hey,  Hey, meu pai,  Hey,  ou tipo,  minha irmã,  ou minha irmã,  ou qualquer coisa,  se alguém que você conhece,  estará interessado,  eu faço isso agora,  e então eu acho que é muito útil  para as pessoas ver esses screenshots aqui,  se você já se perguntou,  como fazer o,  ou como realmente  chegar para as pessoas assim.  Uma coisa que eu gostei da história,  eu estava tipo,  eu acho que é nada louco,  tipo,  nada é louco,  é só chegar para as pessoas que você conhece,  normalmente,  o jeito que eu acharei,  se você é 19,  com nenhum networks,  e você não tem ninguém a saber,  você acharei que é tipo,  você tem que saber,  você tem que saber,  ninguém que seja interessado,  para ajudar,  ou,  tipo,  ajudar com a gente.  E se eles são interessados,  eles vão dizer,  sim, eu gostaria disso,  mas,  se não,  então,  você vai ter uma conexão de segundo nível também,  então,  isso é uma estratégia de marido,  não é como eu inventei isso,  é um trabalho,  então,  eu vou fazer isso.  E é isso que você tem que fazer com a história,  eu acho que isso é um negócio não-negotiável,  menos que você tenha  muito tração,  que você não tem que pegar 3 clientes,  mas eu acho que isso é muito importante.  Qualquer outra rota,  a comunidade da escola,  que você está About to Breakdown,  é um bom trabalho também,  mas se a forma mais rápida  para ter o primeiro 1, 2, 3 clientes,  vai ser por aquele network que você tem.  É mais rápido,  tipo, você pode fazer isso amanhã,  você sabe,  se você conhece alguém,  você pode fazer isso amanhã,  maxar o seu contact list  com 3, 1,  e você vai ter algo,  tipo, eu posso garantir,  você pode fazer 4, 3, 1.  Eu tenho um grande guide  sobre a comunidade da guerra,  então eu vou linkar isso abaixo,  você pode pegar o Breakdown,  a estratégia que o McKelley está usando agora.  A próxima estratégia,  para mim, é a comunidade da escola.  Então, eu actually joined  a comunidade da escola free.  Agora, é insano,  na verdade, a maioria das pessoas  que estão lá,  mas isso,  para mim, era tipo,  onde eu vou,  onde as pessoas estão perguntando  para o trabalho,  e porque você era tipo,  o cara que estava fazendo  todas essas coisas  e tinha uma comunidade free,  a maioria das pessoas só se juntaram,  então,  em seu trabalho,  para o trabalho,  a maioria das pessoas  que estavam perguntando para o trabalho,  tipo,  você sabe alguém  que está capaz de fazer X, Y, Z.  E,  esse é o trabalho que eu vi,  do meu cara,  que é o meu amigo agora,  ele era meu primeiro,  meu segundo cliente,  neste caso,  e ele estava procurando  para um cara de chapeau,  um cara de chapeau,  e eu justiamos ele,  eu disse,  Ei, eu sou da U.K.,  eu construi chapeaus,  pode me ajudar no call?  E isso foi o primeiro cliente,  isso foi o segundo cliente.  E isso...  É assim,  outra coisa  que eu já me escutei  para as pessoas fazer,  é tipo,  se você,  a gente tem, tipo,  500 a,  às vezes,  1000 pessoas a dia,  que estão indo para aquela comunidade,  estão either posting  in the introductions  and saying,  Hey,  like I am XYZ,  I do this,  and you can just reach out  and make a connection.  Or the hiring channel,  where there's people looking for,  either looking for developers,  or they have a specific project in mind.  So, if you actually go in there  and at the same time,  if you grind a bit of sort of clout  within the community  and you start to post  and like create a bit about,  it will share a bit of value.  Being the go to people  or notable in that community  is so much business,  you can get off the back of that.  So,  it's great to see this being,  being like actioned on  and seeing results from up,  because I know that hiring board  has got so much sourcing up.  I think it's so underrated.  I mean,  especially because it's 200 plus  K people in the community  and some posts  don't even get any comments  or wanted to comments  like a small opportunity out there.  They can just take action on.  So, these two were the different  strategies that I used to get  my first clients,  clients,  in this case,  the first two for free,  or more,  we're more rich and then school community.  And do you want to just give us  an insight to you,  maybe a bit vulnerable?  What was it really like  doing this first few clients, bro?  Like, did you feel out of depth?  Or did you feel that you prepared  well enough  with the material  being through on learning  automations?  Like,  what was going through your head  at that point?  It was horrible.  I didn't know anything.  I just hopped on a call.  I just told them that I do chatbots  and I was like,  I can make your chatbot better.  And then we went on the call.  We went off the call  and I was meant to use  make.com as well  for like the chatbot  and I had zero idea  how to do it.  And I had busy  to spend three, four days  going on authorizations  with the client  and he got his stuff  and he goes to me.  So, like, that was the first.  So, that's  setting up the  setting up the accounts on make, yeah?  On HubSpot, on VoiceFlow,  on webhooks.  And you know what a webhook was  at that time?  Just zero.  He just goes to me at that time.  So, yeah.  I mean, for the beginners,  what's the best way that you've  there's a bunch of different ways  of approaching it.  But for those initial setups,  like, do you have loom videos now?  Do you have a like SOP  that you pass over to the client  for setting them up  on certain platforms  or giving you access?  Like, what's the way  that you've refined that?  I think for me,  the way that you...  I like to hop on calls.  Like, I've tried different things.  I've tried sending loom videos on  because I already had tutorials  and hey, here's how you can make  your make.com account.  Here's how to connect  your Google Sheets to make.com.  But I found that even  with showing a step-by-step video,  the client still has questions.  So, you might as well  just go on a call with them  and just walk in through.  Hey, share your screen.  Click here, click there,  connect this, connect that.  And then it's just not better  even if you invest at one hour.  It would be there anyways.  All right, cool.  Now we can get to getting more clients.  So now we got three clients.  We got the first, the second client.  How can get more people to know  about our stuff?  In my opinion,  when I first got started,  the thing for me was content.  That's the thing that I saw you do  and that really inspired me  to just post content  as soon as possible  because content is actually one to many,  which means that you can make one content,  a one piece of content,  it can go to a million of people  so you can get a lot of stuff from there.  Now, when you get,  when I got introduced to content,  I got introduced to Medium,  YouTube, LinkedIn, X, and Instagram.  And one thing that I find  a lot of times  that people try to stretch themselves out  and just do everything.  And that's something that I did  at the start of all  because I did a YouTube,  I did LinkedIn,  I did, I think, Medium.  I had no,  I at least, I was doing everything.  And thankfully I had people like Casey  who told me man,  I stopped messing about,  just just focus on one platform  and just do it, do it really well.  Yeah, this is like a chronic beginner issue.  And I always try to hammer it home,  but just like one is enough.  Even for me,  like I'm I barely post on LinkedIn.  We're starting to post a bit more  to talk about what we're doing  at Morningside.  X, we've just started posting on consistently.  Instagram,  I basically never post  and Medium I've never done.  Like, if you just do one platform  and do it really well,  particularly the big ones,  like if you're just doing YouTube  pretty well or just doing LinkedIn,  I've seen guys doing  short form content on Instagram  and getting tons of leads  for their agency  and their school communities  through short form on Instagram.  And I'm sure you could do the same on Twitter.  Like, I don't really think  there's anyone really running the X,  the X base  when it comes to automation agencies  and things like that.  So if you just pick one  and do it well,  we've had even guys  in the accelerated doing  the medium strategy  and just posting on medium  and getting tons of leads  for their agency like that.  So you just got to pick one  and do it well  because is that skill curve  of like actually getting deep  in the platform  and realizing, OK,  what are the trending formats?  OK, I've done enough  for these posts now that  oh, this one popped off  and you just start following  these little grains of truth  from the data  that you get back on your posts,  which ensures  what you're going to  we're going to break down now.  So for me, OK,  so I got introduced  all these platforms.  My decision on why I chose LinkedIn  was based on where do  the people that I want to target?  Where did they hang out?  And what was I most comfortable  using at the time?  And so the LinkedIn content  that I had,  the strategy behind it is something  is the reason why I booked  over 300, 400 calls  just off of organic content.  And it was separate  into three different types of posts.  The first one is the automation videos,  which is to show your expertise.  The second one is leave my mates  to provide good stuff for free.  And then the third one is personal  show that you're human  that you have a story  that you're not  that you just have feelings and stuff.  So that's the main  thing about content and that part of site.  Now, the automation videos  itself, what they are  and what I did then  is just you got as many nodes  on the screen as you could.  That's the hook.  The crazier, the crazier it looks.  It's like the 181s now  is like the crazier  that the scenario  or the workflow looks.  But yeah, I mean,  it stops the scroll, doesn't it?  Exatamente.  It's just hooks them.  So YouTube was where I learned.  So I learned YouTube  and then I actually posted on LinkedIn.  This was crazy to me.  I was I was watching YouTube videos  somewhere building automation.  I was making them with them.  So I was actually learning  through the process  and I was posting it on LinkedIn.  And then I got clients.  Like that for me  was like just a crazy process  that I have to go through  because I'm it just people  over complicated so much.  You just learn.  I was what you learn  and then just do it over and over and over.  That's what I call  like the potential framework.  I think you would have seen  in the accelerator as well.  But this is very,  very powerful upward spiral  that I got stuck in  and you've got stuck in.  And anyone else  who's really succeeding  in the space gets stuck in,  which is he realizes  when you start doing content  off the back of your skills acquisition.  Like when you learn a certain thing,  you are like,  you're not just learning in isolation.  You are learning for the sake of content  and then that can help you to get leads  and then those leads convert into clients  and then those clients give you learnings  and then you can talk about that  in your content again.  So it's this like powerful  upward spiral where like  some people will just learn in isolation  and learn, learn, learn, learn  and then they'll try to like  go and market whatever they've learned.  But if you're learning  and creating content at the same time  and just really, really exploring  your own curiosities  and like how far can I push this tech?  That was like the biggest secret for me  was just finding something  that I was totally nerd and out about  and I just wanted like  it felt like play to me  because I was just cooking up  this awesome stuff  and then I made a video about it.  And like that,  I'm sure you can agree  is when you get into that  like real playful zone  is when you make your best content  and what's when you're making  content that's really pushing  the boundaries of the space  and that's what's actually unique.  The lesson with content  that if you just do this  like you just succeed  is post content  as you get good,  not when you get good.  That's like the main thing  that you just mentioned here is like  like no  just document what you're doing  because there's no real experts  in the industry.  I actually feel like  there's no real experts.  This shit only came out  like two years ago.  So that's why I think  that's just important.  So automation videos  is just to show your expertise.  This is you building an automation  and showing hey guys,  this is the automation I built.  This is what it does  and fundamentally  like when I started  I was working with zero clients.  So I wasn't showing  any automations  that I built for clients.  I was just showing automations  that I just built for fun.  You know,  and that's what I think  one of the roadblocks  that I got started with  I was like OK,  but I post videos  like I have no clients.  How can I post videos  about automations  that I built for clients?  Yeah, personal projects.  I keep shouting  from the roof about that as well.  Like if you're looking to get started,  find some personal projects  like talk to that GPT  and get it's like  help you pull some ideas out.  But there's some personal projects  either if you're doing voice agents,  if you're doing workflow automation,  if you're doing like tech space agents,  there are some personal projects  that you can do.  Yeah,  and because of the fact  that we're targeting business owners,  the thing to understand is like  business owners don't have the time  to set it up,  but they have the time  to be on their phones,  look at what's possible in this space  to then reach out to you for help.  And that's like the thing.  Now, the second part is lead magnets.  Now, if I were to point  the success that I had on LinkedIn,  it probably was on the lead magnets  that I made.  So lead magnets  fundamentally comes from the fact  that you're playing  within LinkedIn's algorithm.  So the way it works is that  you make a post.  Let's say you, Liam,  you comment on my post,  your whole network,  everyone that follows you  sees that you  in my post is like a compounding effect  that it just follows.  And as you can see,  I mean, it did pretty well.  Damn,  that's so important to point out  how the algorithm actually works  on LinkedIn.  It's a cycle of YouTube.  You understand that they  incentivize to recommend videos  that are going to lead to long watch  times and long sessions  just and on LinkedIn.  Anytime someone comments,  if you can try to bait someone  into commenting,  like if you may be made a post  about me and then I happen to  comment on it,  then boom, it goes to my whole  network, right?  And so the lead magnets  like this and asking them  to comment is going to get  all of that spread out  into other people's network,  right?  Like the thing about LinkedIn  that I found over time is that  it doesn't so much matter  about the algorithm itself.  It's more so that you just share  value.  Like the way that you share  value is different.  Right here is through a video  showing Hey guys,  I just built this.  Here's what it does.  I've never worked with a  business, but here's what it  does.  And here is just me  giving away some stuff.  And that's paying the  LinkedIn algorithm.  I'll break down the exact post  and how they work  a lot of stuff so we can go  that into more detail.  The third one is personal.  Show that you're human.  Again, this right here,  I think it's so underrated.  You saw Merit,  he did some personal posts  that did really well.  Is the fact that LinkedIn  necessarily like two years ago  through three years ago,  it was just seen as a hiring  platform.  I still think it is seen  as a hiring platform.  And with the fact that LinkedIn  is seen as a as a very serious  platform and everyone's so serious  and so like I'm proud to announce  then people don't necessarily  care about their personal stories.  And that's like that to announce.  And that's like the main  thing is like if everyone's  so professional,  don't be professional.  Be yourself.  Just share about your story.  Of course, like to the limit,  but personal always builds up.  This is what builds a brand.  Like this right here,  I think what helps build a brand  of like you're not just  zoom in onto that bottom one.  Like several performance  start learning sec.  That's like showing behind  the scenes, the grind.  That's like so so powerful, man.  And what I really love  about that, this whole  strategy, if you zoom out of it,  is like these are different  content formats to zoom out  to all three of them.  And this is something that  you guys really need to  regardless of what kind of  content you're doing  is finding these different formats.  And if you look at this,  it's fricking genius  because you have to lead magnets  which are helping you  to get pushed out into the algorithm.  That's the discovery.  It's like on YouTube  here I'll make some videos  that are intended to go broad  and get me discovered  by new people.  Those lead magnets  are going to get you shown  to a lot of new people.  Then when they come in,  they might like or follow  or connect with you in some way  and then they'll see on your page.  You've got all of these  show your expertise video.  So while those might not go as crazy,  they will see that  oh, this guy's actually  better consistent track record  of posting things that he knows.  So not only did he put this out,  but one, he's a real person  and he's got these like  this is someone I might want to work  with because he's obviously  into some interesting things  or he's working really hard  and he's got the expertise.  This is like  I say why this is work for you so well  is because you've got that discovery mechanism  and then the credibility and authority  and then also that human element to it.  So if you guys are doing content  across any platform,  the same thing applies.  You need to find out  how you're going to get pushed  into the algorithm  and how you're going to get discovered  and then how you're going to show  your expertise  and then some element of  of being a real person  that people can actually relate to.  So I think you've  fricking cracked it, mate.  That's a textbook.  But I mean  like we mentioned  focusing on what platform.  This is exactly why  before I before I could put this together  to show you guys,  it took me a year,  like a solid year,  which isn't a long time,  but like hours and hours  and hours and hours  just in my room,  just understanding what it is,  how to do it,  how to just get better and better  and better and invested money  into like LinkedIn coaching  and all that sort.  Like all this stuff that I did  to get really good on one platform  and I'm still not good enough  to tell you enough  like just being one platform  is just so so key  because like this is hard.  Imagine trying to do that  across three at once.  It's just no way.  Yeah, that's why most people  just stick to one platform.  Then they expand to different  platform than one platform  good enough.  OK, so the automation  video is the magnets personal.  The let's go on a deeper level.  Let's look at the actual breakdown  of the post itself.  Each post on LinkedIn  is similar.  It has a hook,  it has a body and cta.  Now cta optional,  depending on the type of post  that you make  by something that I always like to have  because it drives them to take action.  So the hook right here.  One of the most important things  about the post  because fundamentally  when you go on LinkedIn,  most people don't know this,  but 70% of the audience  or people who are using LinkedIn  are at work on their phones.  Right?  So you want to make sure that the hook  itself has 40 characters online,  which is mobile optimized,  summarizes the whole post.  So when I look at this,  I basically I really want to  understand exactly  what the post is about  without having to read it  and best ad numbers.  So when you add numbers,  it just shows results,  more credibility,  something that would more willing  to do, especially for  business owners  because they have no time  they want to see exactly  how it impacts them  and how like the outcome  the outcome that they can have  at the wrong places  by looking at this post.  Then we have the body of the email.  So this right here is just  in this case,  the list works great.  So step one is this  step two is this three and four.  And again,  this is for automation video.  So hey, I built this automation.  Here's what it does,  right?  In this case,  is what it does part.  Avoid paragraphs,  make it easy for the reader.  Again, me,  you've probably seen posts on LinkedIn  that are just like  three paragraphs long.  Nobody reads that.  So don't even like  don't even try that.  And like you've got  those little arrows  put in there as well  to like literally guide the eyes  onto the next  onto the next line.  It's not just a bullet point.  It's like actually  an arrow pointing them to it.  So like guarding their eyes  through each line.  Now the CTA,  which is essentially  what do we want the  the person to do?  A lot of people don't add this,  which you're missing out on  because a lot of people  because of the LinkedIn algorithm  because like commenting  is like a big part of LinkedIn  and you want someone  to drive action  to take action do something.  In this case,  why don't install them here?  Here's the next step  you want to take  in this case  because I'm repurposing  a YouTube content.  You can say, hey,  link in the comments  for the Google walkthrough.  So fundamentally,  that's a strategy  that I have for LinkedIn.  And I mean, right here,  I broke down exactly  how we can write each post  to different types of posts.  And and so on.  We'll leave the link  down below  just in case  you want to take a look at it.  Yeah, there's tons of good stuff here, guys.  So if you are wanting to do LinkedIn  and really break down the strategy,  a Cala is really fully broken down  how he's writing these posts.  So for the sake of the people who aren't,  maybe you're going to  go all in on LinkedIn.  I'll link that down below  where there's other links there.  You guys can check this out.  Super valuable.  I mean,  if there's anything you want to copy  or take inspiration from,  then it's just so  I really appreciate you sharing this with the guys.  Yeah, no worries.  And honestly,  like the formats of the post  are very templated in a sense.  So if you follow once,  if you see it once,  you won't see it.  You will not forget it  and you just copy it.  So that's pretty much it  for the content strategy.  And then down below,  I mean,  that is the reason why I was booking  two to six calls a day  from LinkedIn Organic  with no nothing paid,  which is pretty unheard of  to say from one LinkedIn account  from one guy just in his bedroom  just trying to make it.  I think that two to six calls a day  was was pretty good.  And that was all  what was your what was your like  conversion mechanism  off that because obviously  a lot of engagement.  I hear a lot of people  saying I might have got  a bit of traction or impressions,  but I wasn't able to convert those  into book calls or qualified calls.  So we use like  you're shooting them  their link to the resource  and the DMs  and then you're starting a conversation  from there or how much  are you automating this as well?  So the funny thing is  I didn't send a single DM for months  like a single DM.  What I was doing is just  putting the lead magnet  and then updating the post  later with the link  and then letting them know.  Now, fundamentally, like,  yes, I was sending them the resource,  but I wasn't pushing for a call  because previously,  what I know, what I did before  was like I put the  the magnet, for example,  like the 3000 comments.  I was just on my phone  replying to each one.  I'll send it to you.  I'll send in the magnet.  I'd never follow up  because I didn't need to  because I was getting  already two to six  calls a day just from like  just yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's a supply issue,  not a demand issue.  It was the same thing.  Same thing.  I think anyone who gets  their acquisition  and particularly content  working well runs this like  for a set morning site.  It's not never been a  never been a demand issue.  It's always been a supply  like how many new clients  can we actually take on  because there's just so much,  especially when you're doing  general div.  I mean, I guess it's like a  good problem to have,  but it's still like it was  still pretty bad.  Yeah, because the conversion  off of like the book calls  is horrible.  I mean, we can get into it.  Those process that I had  was consultation 45 minutes  and proposal call another 45 minutes  and then I had a 5% close rate.  Now, that's not even noticeable.  I mean, that's horrible,  but the close rate was honestly  it's just a numbers game.  I'm like out of 100  people that I speak to,  I think one of them is going to  say yes, you know, and  and in between the consultation  and the proposal is like  four hours of like prepping  and proposal writing  and prep like putting together  the slide deck and getting ready  to like present it to them.  Right.  So I mean, we would spend like  four to six hours  like prepping as the projects  get bigger and bigger as well.  There's like way more  you need a cover and more  more like working with the devs  to figure how long it's going to take.  But yeah, give us  the how do you get over this one, bro?  I love this part  on that note, man.  I was using Canva  like every day for like three  four hours is putting  like Jackie said, prepare  this looks pretty.  This looks nice.  But over time, you realize  like you can cut it down.  And you get on the call  and they just not  realize you haven't financially  qualified them at all.  And then they like they see the price  and they go like they get a shock  and then you just never hear from again.  So exactly.  Yeah.  So the problem here  wasn't the one of book calls  that I got is just conversion.  Like I had no friction,  which means that I had  I think two or three questions  on the after form.  They could book in at any time  they wanted for how long  they wanted and they just  just came right in.  Right.  And I just had a book calls  every single day.  I was so stressed.  I was it was just horrible.  The process that I went through  to actually solve this  was to actually changing  my my sales process.  So fundamentally,  just adding more friction,  which means that you  now tell the client  we will have a 20 minute  consultation, which is free  so they can book in  and this is more than enough  time, more than enough time  to like figure out exactly  like sort of like where  they're at and so on.  And then if they're qualified,  not qualified, but if they're  yeah, qualified, I'll say  then you pitch an audit.  Now, this is something that I got  off of your video  where you mentioned an expougatory  exploration.  Yeah, exactly.  So that's that's the thing  that I implemented.  So hey, if you want to work  with me, you have to pay two hundred  dollars for one hour for the audit.  So that actually made it worth my time  to even hop on a call  with the business owner  and that did three things.  That increased my my ability  to close because I spent  more time with the business owner  so I could actually like teach  them some stuff in a sense  and actually take them  through different things.  See more opportunities for upsells  later on, because when you break  down everything and not it,  you start to see more problems,  more problems.  So you can start making like a roadmap  as to like we can do this  first and then that.  And then the third thing is just  you get more qualified people  because if they're willing to pay  for the audit, they're  they're going to be willing to pay  for for whatever it is that you  have.  Yeah, no, this is key guys.  I'll put the video  that that Micaela is referencing  here on on how we do  exploration milestones  at Morningside link that down  below as well, but it's  really important.  We have the same issues at Morningside  terrible close rate despite tons  and tons of leads.  And as soon as you put a financial  qualification in, either  like it's a quick audit call  or it's like we would hop off  the end of our consults  at Morningside and we'd say, OK,  yeah, we're ready to go on this  basically, like there's a few  is always a few unknowns here.  So we're going to start at  like 800 or 1500  or now it's like five, ten  thousand dollars for us, what we  charge for these initial  engagements, but we're going to  explore these different solutions  and we're going to see if  that's actually technically  feasible for you.  And then at the end of that,  you get the full proposal  and then we can move into the  next next part of the contract.  What was it for you?  The how did you know when to  price the audit, the milestone  that you either went to  or how to price it?  How did you know how much  how much to price them?  Because you mentioned  there's like three pancake.  Yeah, it's based off  the size of the client  and also the size of the project.  So if it's like a huge one  and we're talking about  it's going to be like a hundred  two hundred thousand dollar project.  We've just done a  expiration phase  were in the middle of one  just wrapping up at the moment  that's I think it was ten  thousand dollars or at least five  figures for the expiration  part alone.  And that started as like a  five hundred dollar like fuck it.  Let's see if they say yes.  And then it went up to eight hundred  then the thousand and like  we just gradually increased it  as the size of our clients grow as well.  So you can just start super low  like you do with this this audit  just anything to financially  qualify them to get the tire kicks out.  Now the input  I see improved  because I my closer  went to 40 percent,  which is much better  like an edX  no 5 percent that I had.  I was so much less stressed  out of making more  because the quality of clients  was increasing  and I was working with  less clients, less calls  and more time to do whatever I want.  All right.  So that right there  fundamentally is how  the LinkedIn strategy was  and that's what I used  to get more people to know  about myself.  The next milestone  or phase that I had to go through  was productizing my offer.  Now, the reason why  I wanted to productize my offer  it was by choice  because with me  the common cost over for automations  because of the reason  why it's custom  you get a lot of problems  that I had to go through.  The first one is scope creep.  So every single client  that you that you get into  doing a project,  what it looks like at the start  and what it actually looks like  the end.  It's completely different.  So it was it was it wasn't that nice  when you had to figure it  when you figured out that  something couldn't be done  the way that you thought it was  or when the client told you hey  we actually have this step  and I thought that changes everything.  And then you got to like be a bit of an ass  you feel like you've been an asshole  about it you're like.  No, but like that's  that's not what we agreed on man.  Like we're going to  I'm going to need to charge you more  for that and that's  I'm uncomfortable  discussions that I think  early agency owners  maybe aren't super great  at dealing with  by just like knowing your value  and saying no this is  this is what we agreed on  so yeah.  I mean it's just about understanding  that you're helping them  like they're not like  they're not helping you  at the sense, you know  so like position yourself  as like I mean  I'm making you a favor  so like let's  let's just work together  to make sure that we can  we can get this going  and whatever extra work  we need the only thing  for me at the start  was like I told them  let's say we're doing  onboarding system  the outcome is  we'll do a fully onboarding  a fully automated onboarding  system  but that's the outcome  exciting the contract  but the onboarding system  changed over time  but the outcome was still  I had to do the onboarding  I still had to do project  yes or yes  and that wasn't  that was non-negotiable for us  and you can talk to the client  and so on  but at the start it was  it was in something that I  that I had the  the boss who just  go to the client  and just say  alright so when it came  to productizing my offer  apart from scope creep  we also had the knowledge gap  so knowledge gap  just means that  whenever a new client  came through  they're from a different niche  I had to re-learn  the whole market  to contextualize  the automation  to like their business  and so that came from  from just not knowing  any niche  but projectizing my offer  the first part of it  was just niching down  and so what I did  is I analyzed  the past 10 months of clients  and I asked myself  who did I like to work with  what brought the most money  and what recurring problem  that I get asked  to solve the most  and that's like the  and that's the fundamental  thing of like  I used to niche down  and I analyzed all my calls  all the clients that I worked with  all that sort of stuff  to then niche down to  to the offer  that I'm running now  which is again  working with agencies  in specific  for the client delivery  which is very very niche  that's so fine man  I think  I nailed it  that's such like  for the people  that you're trying to help  that's like exactly  what they want to hear  double client capacity  without hiring more people  in 30 days  it's so specific  that's just such  a fire positioning statement  so niche  this is like  this super niche  I mean there's  there's not a lot of people  who do this  but fundamentally  it's like  when you niche down  you're just scared  that you're just missing  out on opportunities  but for me it's like  I couldn't do  the custom work anymore  so I had to do  so you can do every single time  but also I knew the niche  really well  and I could solve  the actual problem that they had  and by the way  if you guys want to take a look  at the LinkedIn profile  that I had  when I actually had the offer  this is what it looked like  outcome, picture, statement  and then the above section as well  awesome  yeah I mean that's super  super good way to line it out  and so for me  the important thing was  prioritizing my offer  to make things repeatable  so the delivery itself  had to be repeatable  because it was solving  one pain point for  one niche  and so the delivery  process that we had  was using a framework  that I made over time  it all started with the audit  so fundamentally what this is  is a call  with me and the founder  just breaking down  the process that  they went through from the moment  a client signs  to the moment a client  they deliver the service  and the whole process  they had to go through that  now this process was  crucial again  because without this  we can't go to the next step  so fundamentally  we just break down  the whole thing  is about one to two hour calls  that we do with the clients  and yeah  this is an example that we had  then we have  the implementation phase  and this is where we centralize  their product management system  and these are the dashboards  where they  basically manage  their whole client delivery  so team tasks  projects  all that sort of stuff there  and so this is you migrating them  over to something  that you've built right  so this is the template  that you've created  and you're like  this is my system  this is how you're going to be  able to scale your  increased number of clients  you can handle without  hiring more people  so you're sort of pushing them  onto this  because I know the niche  really well  and I know the agencies  to manage your client delivery  they use one software  and other software  and three other software  and everything so scattered  so notion is a software  and it's a  particular  do  do  do  do  o  do  o  o  do  do  do  do  do  Permit  o  do  o  do  do  o  Tentando mudar as promessas, te making sure it's all working as expected.  100%!  I knew the niche really well, and they all had similar problems, they all had a similar process.  So it wasn't like a crazy amount of difference from each sort of agency.  And the next part is train, so we obviously had a delivery call with the team, we made SOPs,  that we can put them in notion so they know exactly how the whole system works.  And then we have the optimized period which is 60 days, so we improve the system over time,  we jump up by weekly calls with the whole team,  and make sure that any changes are made after using the system.  Now this is great for us because we get to cultivate the relationship with the client,  which I believe is one of the most important things as you get into a higher ticket.  Because this right here, this offer was going for 9.5K.  9.5K?  Yeah.  The empire, that's way more than I would have expected, that's freaking awesome.  Just positioning bro.  Positioning bro, and it's also like if you got enough leads, you can afford to be,  you know, like the more demand you have on these calls,  if you have only 10 people coming to you, you might have to sell it for 5,  because the chance of you having people who are willing to pay that much is a lot less.  But you have 100 people, there's going to be a handful of those who do have the budgets  and are willing to spend more on this AI stuff than the others.  You can kind of volume your way into high ticket,  which is basically what we've done at Morningside as well.  I mean, just to let you know, I ran an offer campaign on LinkedIn  to get these clients, I sent about 580 Loons,  personalized Loons, to people,  and to get one client, which is 10K.  But like in the outside, it's like so much better because it's 10K,  instead of just to pay, which is like a normal project.  So ideally you want to work with less clients, pay more,  and increase the price of the message you've ever made.  So that's that.  All right, let me go to the last milestone or the last process  that I have to go through, which is how to outsource.  So how to make sure that now you have all these clients,  you have these projects, how can you give it to someone else  so you can focus on actually growing the business, making content  because it is a full-time job, like James said.  So the strategy for me was using three different places.  The first one was the AAA school community.  So I just put a post here, which is a full circle moment  because I used to look for jobs here  and now I'm putting a job there for someone to talk to me.  That's the ecosystem man, like it works.  And I'm on my YouTube videos telling business owners  like go into my school community and post for like make posts  saying you're looking for certain things.  Like you can come in here to make posts about hiring as well.  And then other people can come in here looking for work.  Like it's a perfect meeting of the two sides of this space right now.  100%.  And the second thing for me was making a post on LinkedIn  asking if anyone's interested.  Now because I was doing Notion as well, like it was more,  it wasn't something that I could ID define here.  I mean, I posted here.  I didn't get anything great off of Notion,  but work for automations because it's the A automation space.  I got tons of people.  So that was different for me.  So LinkedIn as well.  And then the accelerator, I mean, you guys have a whole,  literally a whole like place to find people  when they're vetted, like you put them there if they're not good.  So I use it as well.  All right.  And when I'm sourcing to other people,  the problems that you're going to find when you're,  when you're giving work to someone else,  at least that I find is you don't have enough cash flow  to hire someone full time to hire freelancer.  The problem is that freelancers are cheap,  but and they're lower quality, right?  So that means you have to spend more time on training  and resources and what I found,  at least the freelancers that I worked for,  they weren't delivering on timelines that I set.  But it's like the balance was like you want to pay more  for someone who's more skilled,  but you don't have the cash flow compared  to someone who is cheaper,  but you have to spend more time into like making sure  that they do the right job.  Yeah, I've been, I've been ringing the spell for a long time.  We had this,  it was our first,  when I was getting morning side AI off the ground,  it was, it was Upwork Freelancers initially.  And they just, you're one of,  you're one of 10 clients.  And I mean,  they're probably not even like,  they might just be good at reaching out  out to people within the community  and they've got a lot of projects,  but they're not super skilled.  And so you want to be able to get to that point  where you can pay someone to get all of their time.  And that's such a big unlock  for any, any agency  or anything you're doing here in the AI space  is that first full time developer  because they can drive so much  in results and deliveries for you.  So there's a tricky period initially  what these are with the freelancers.  I mean,  the good thing about my offer was that  it wasn't so custom.  So like I could train someone to do it.  And the thing that really ended up happening  was I just got a Notion guy  who just did Notion stuff  because that was like the main thing  structuring the system  and I offloaded the make.com  to someone else as well.  So I had these two people in the same time.  Now the solutions that I can  that you can implement that I implemented  was set expectations on day one.  Make them want to work with you.  I think that's one of the main things is like,  I mean,  if you have someone who's good,  who's I mean,  if you have someone who you can see potential  that they're actually good.  Make them want to work with you  like in best timing to make sure that they're all set  to make sure that you stay  when you basically form a long form relationship  because working with someone,  I mean,  your business, your baby,  you want to make sure that it actually grows  and you want to make sure that the people  who are taking care of the business  are just they're solid  and they have a this year vision  super invested in what you're doing.  Yeah,  that's that's part of it  when the leadership skills come into play  is like painting the vision.  I mean like look,  we're going places like this is  do you want to be on the ship?  Like look,  I want to get you into these roles  like you can really step up into this position  and the right people will respond really well to that  and that's that's how I've always approached leading these people  and right here.  I mean,  we walked through the whole five step process  that I went through to get to 100k  with the agency  and fundamentally along the way  you just get to learn new skills  for here is just automations  then here is how to reach out to people  for the first time  and here is content  which is a massive one  here is offers leads  all that sort of stuff  that you want to know  and then here is how to outsource  which is fundamentally all the skills  you need to learn  you're going to have to learn  to get to that point.  Yeah,  I mean,  it's it's the the business 101 skill set, right?

            "resumo": "Este vídeo oferece um guia prático para iniciantes sobre como usar IA para ir de 0 a 100 mil e avançar rumo a 100 milhões. O autor afirma que o primeiro milhão é mais fácil que o próximo patamar e apresenta o roteiro para começar na IA. Ele destaca 5 desafios prévios ao sucesso e oferece soluções para cada um. O ponto-chave é escolher uma área específica e não tentar fazer tudo de uma vez, já que muitos começam montando uma agência de automação, com agentes de voz ou bots de texto. A recomendação central é focar na automação de trabalho, com Make.com como base da IA Automation Agency. A habilidade fundamental é entender APIs e como as aplicações se comunicam. O conteúdo útil vem do YouTube e de recursos gratuitos, permitindo começar mesmo sem dinheiro, e usar isso para evoluir com o tempo.",
