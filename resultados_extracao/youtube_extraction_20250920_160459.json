          "transcript": " Não se preocupe, você será a próxima vez que deixe ir durante o layout da companhia.  A AI está mudando os rostos se você escolhe as melhores habilidades.  Então, neste vídeo, eu vou mostrar a você 7 habilidades de high-paying de AI que os trabalhadores  despertamente precisam e exatamente como você pode master eles em apenas 30 dias para  fazer você irreplacável, quase nenhum péssaro necessário.  Quase 1,5 milhão de técnicos ter perdido seus trabalhos desde 2023.  E muitos de eles foram muito habilidos e ainda foram replacados.  Alguns de eles eram meus amigos. Eles ainda estão.  E assistindo eles a perder o trabalho, apesar de seus talentos, me atentou muito.  Mas alguns, eles pivam.  Eles pegaram as habilidades de AI e estão fazendo mais do que eles fizeram em Big Tech.  Então, durante o ano passado, eu estou obsessando sobre uma pergunta.  O que são as habilidades que fazem você irreplacável em um mundo de AI?  E eu pego por dozens de repórteres de indústria, pesquisas de pesquisas, estudos de caso,  e eu acredito que tudo aponta a essas 7.  E a última?  É a habilidade que ninguém fala sobre, mas quando você tem, os clientes nunca resumem.  Eu acredito que vivemos em uma educação de rápido e alunos.  Não de graus, e certamente, não de plantas de 10 anos.  Mas a maioria dos clientes moram em uma trapa de alunos.  Eles saem de um aluno para outro, um curso para um curso,  estacando habilidades de alunos e sentindo produtivas,  enquanto nunca realmente monetizando nada.  E eu sei que é bom, mas é só uma trapa de dopamina.  Ou, mais ou menos, uma excusa de nunca se mover e escolher para ser paralisado por medo de imperfeição.  A verdade é que, sendo ótimo em uma skill de valor alto,  eu acredito que isso é uma habilidade de alunos e um alunos para ser paralisado por medo de imperfeição.  E para realmente servir o necessário enquanto é em seu alunos.  Porque eu acredito que a realidade é que, se você spenta 4 anos ensinando 7 habilidades diferentes ou mais,  pelo tempo em que você está pronto a vender, o ambiente já vai ter mudado.  As oportunidades, hoje em dia, são bastante perigosas.  As pessoas que ganham são os que escolham uma skill de valor alto.  Eles vão de novo, rápido, e monetizam-se enquanto a demanda ainda é a mais alta.  Você não tem que ver o que está acontecendo.  Pense em um compasso.  O seu trabalho é escolher um, ir para baixo, e então construir ou ser um parceiro para o resto.  Isso é como você se torna irreplacável.  Então, a primeira linha é o que eu chamo de strategista visionário.  E eu entendo que pode ser um abstrato de que eu expliquei.  A verdade bruta é que a maioria das empresas experimentam com AI,  mas 85% dos projetos de AI falam.  Por que?  Bem, não porque os modelos são velhos e certamente não porque os produtos não funcionam,  é muitas vezes porque não há uma estratégia clara.  As empresas só chamam de produtos de shiny.  Mas ninguém está perguntando as questões mais grandes.  Onde o AI faz o dinheiro? Onde é o momento de salvo?  Onde pode o bloco?  E esse gapo, que fica entretido por os strategistas visionários.  Esse é um strategista de AI, se você pensar sobre isso.  É a arquitetura de decisão e consulta.  É a pessoa que desenha como o AI fit into business decisions.  É basicamente como ser o arquiteto que traga o blueprinto antes de os builders chegar.  E antes de você ir para as conclusões,  não, você não é apenas recomendando os produtos.  Isso não é o ponto.  Você está desenhando a arquitetura de decisão,  o que processa para automatizar,  o que métodos para tragar,  e como conseguir manejar o efeito, o financiamento  e os riscos operativos dentro daquele businesses particular.  E eu acho que eu já pensei na revista de Harvard Business,  que isso é o mais crítico do gapo em adopção de AI corporado.  Então, tem claramente uma necessidade para isso.  E se você está pensando,  mas não pode o AI simplesmente fazer isso?  Bem, o que você não pode saber,  é que só 30% das tarefas consultadas  podem até ser automatizadas no próximo ano,  em relação à McKinsey.  O resto requer humanidade, contextos e muita confiança.  E eu acho que, se a gente concorda com o número exacto  ou não, isso não é o ponto desse vídeo,  mas eu sei que o AI não pode replicar isso.  Agora, deixe-me te dar um exemplo,  porque eu acho que isso sempre paga a imagem melhor.  BCG trabalhou com IBM  em uma estratégia de transformação de AI compreendente.  E ao invés de pilotos randomes,  o que eles fizeram  foi que eles construíram uma roadmap  que focussava em funções de apoio,  em liga, IT e procuramento.  E eu acho que H.R. também.  E, como resultado,  IBM colocou 3,5 bilhões de dólares  em costas de salva  e 50% de crescimento em produtividade por dois anos.  Eu acho que isso é um grande impacto  até para uma companhia essa size.  E as companhias estão pagando para essa claridade.  Agora, no LinkedIn,  ou até no appwork,  se você olhar,  você verá que o businesses  estão procurando consultas de estratégia de AI.  E você verá que eles oferecem 70 dólares, 100 dólares,  às vezes, até 200 dólares por hora.  E os retênis para esse tipo de trabalho  vão para milhares de dólares.  E se você está procurando projetos de estratégia de full,  claro, depende do tamanho do businesses que você está procurando.  Mas isso  vai fazer você olhar para vários mil dólares.  E se você quer ser um employee,  Glassdoor mostra que isso é um rol  que se paga entre 107  a 174 mil dólares por ano.  Eu acho que isso.  As pessoas não pagam para prontos  ou para atletas.  Eles pagam para confiança.  Eles pagam para alguém  que pode estar no quarto  e dizer,  aqui é como a AI se passa em seu businesses.  Aqui é como fazer isso seguro  e aqui é como conseguir resultados com isso.  Essa é a estratégia visionária.  Você produz uma roadmap de adoption da AI.  Você produz modelos de ROI,  assesamento de preparação,  governos,  guiões de risco e etc.  Basicamente consultar, mas para a AI.  Então, como você se torna  um estratégia visionária  em 30 dias?  Você não precisa de um phc.  Me pareça.  Você precisa de uma frameworks muito boa.  Uma oferta clara.  Um business acumen  ajuda se você tiver.  E provavelmente o mais importante  é a curação para começar.  Ok, então deixa eu brevar.  Em termos dos 30 dias que eu acho que  você pode fazer em um mês em um,  para ler todas as notícias da indústria que você pode encontrar, mas não com a AI.  Deixe eles, se é o McKinsey ou o HBR ou o Deloitte, eu não careço.  E então, vá lá e suma os inscritos para uma asa de valor AI, pode ser uma pátria.  E aí você pode usar a AI, eu vou te dar isso.  E depois, em semana dois, você pode aprender sobre o ROI e os modelos de risco.  E é legal, você ajudando uma companhia a responder essa pergunta.  Se investimos este muito dinheiro em a AI,  como muito tempo ou dinheiro podemos salvar, ou como muito dinheiro podemos gerar?  E o que costumos cobertos devemos ter em mente também?  Então, o que você pode fazer é construir os modelos e dar um pouco de adopção à adopção de AI.  Isso pode parecer complexo, mas se você tem algum businesses ou bilhões de finanças,  eu sei que você pode fazer isso.  É realmente não tão difícil.  E depois, em semana três, você pode correr dois ou três audições de mock-up,  na sua companhia de amigos, ou ninguém mais,  que seria capaz de ser um guine-pig para você.  E o que você quer é identificar e documentar o tempo,  ou costumos, ou novos oportunidades.  E depois, em semana quatro, você pode lançar sua oferta.  Você pode chamar o auditório de redness do AI para um fio fixado.  E depois você pode seguir com uma mapa de roadmap que você pode carregar um pouco mais.  Mas olha, uma estratégia sem execução é só um papel.  Eu sei que, em meus dias de consulta, a gente used to say that our clients  many times get a report and then they drop it into a drawer and forget about it.  Então, com isso em mente, once you design the roadmap,  companies are probably going to ask, OK, now how do we adopt it?  So that's what lane 2 can offer.  That's the design thinker, the one who actually turns the roadmap into  an automated or more automated workflows.  And if you want speed, this is where the real money shows up, in my opinion.  So if you're excited about all of this opportunity,  but you're also realizing that there's a lot more out there  than just stitching tools together or being at surface level.  Then I genuinely recommend taking a look at the applied generative  AI specialization program delivered by SimplyLearn in partnership  with Purdue University online.  It is one of probably the most comprehensive and practical ways  to master agentic AI, RAG systems, LLM powered applications.  It is a 16 weeks program and your learning curriculum  that has been reviewed and approved by instructors and advisors  with decades of experience in enterprise AI and software engineering.  It includes over 70 hours of hands-on training across tools  like LangChain, OpenAI, Dali, Huggingface, and Copilot.  So if you're serious about mastering this new wave of AI,  not just for fun, but for serious business AI applications,  then this is, in my opinion, a high leverage move.  You can't go ahead and apply now via the link down in the description  as well as the QR code here on the screen.  Cohorts are limited and admission closes soon.  So go ahead and check out the next admissions deadline  and make sure you sign up before that.  And if you're building your career for the long game,  this might just be your launch pad.  Also, thank you SimplyLearn for partnering with us on today's video.  So let's get into the second lane, the design thinker.  This is the workflow optimizer,  the person who redesigns processes.  So humans can focus on decisions while AI and agents  can handle the repetitive work.  And this is not about duct taping tools together.  You will be re-architecting how a business runs.  It's like redesigning a kitchen so the chef can spend less time walking  and more time cooking, okay?  And this is extremely valuable  because most companies don't actually have broken technology.  What they have is broken processes.  And both McKinsey and Deloitte found that the majority of productivity gains  don't come from adding new tools,  but from rethinking the workflow itself.  And here's something that you might not realize.  Those improvements require human insight into culture,  into your organization,  because AI cannot map a messy process or navigate team politics.  Only a human design thinker can do that and the demand is exploding.  I mean, look on any job board and you will see  AI workflow designer, AI automation architect.  All of these are popping up everywhere  and companies are paying top dollar for process redesign projects  and sometimes four or even five figures per month  for ongoing optimization retainers.  And we're going to make sure to include some examples  from Upwork postings  so you can see that what I'm saying is actually true.  I am not making up these numbers.  And if you're wondering, okay, well, what does this exactly do?  Let me give you an example quickly.  We've seen, for example, a marketing agency  that had people manually handling customer onboarding,  taking up to three hours per client.  And then a design thinker came in and mapped the process  and automated 60% of the repetitive steps.  I think it was with Zapier, make and AI integration.  The result was that the onboarding and proposal creation time  dropped from three hours to one hour  and it cut manual work by 70%.  I mean, that is the power of the design thinker.  You make businesses faster, leaner and more scalable.  And if you're thinking, okay, I get the point,  but what would a client actually expect from me?  What they would expect is that you can analyze their current state  and map that and then design the future state  and provide agent specifications and automation opportunities  and KPIs so that they know how to measure success.  And if you put your mind to it,  you can become a design thinker in 30 days.  It's not easy, but I mean,  a lot of great things in life require effort, right?  So what's the 30 day sprint?  In the first week, what I would do  would be to learn the basics of business process management.  That's BPM and design thinking.  There's loads of resources online,  but what you want to make sure is that you understand  how to break the process into clear steps  and spot the bottlenecks.  And then on week two,  I would learn what today's automation tools  and AI agents can actually do  and get familiar with the possibilities  as well as the limitations.  And then on week three,  I would take two to three real processes.  It could be onboarding, invoicing, customer support  and then redesign them using what I would have learned  and show them before and the improved after.  And then week four,  I would package that redesigned process as a process audit  as well as an agent roadmap.  And then I would include the current workflow,  the optimized version and the expected savings.  And I would go and pitch that to a lot of businesses.  And look,  the thing is that once workflows are optimized,  companies want more than efficiency.  They want to actually implement it.  Okay.  So that is lane three that you could also consider.  And I'm calling this one the architect.  Okay.  This is the AI stack design and integration specialist.  You've got a working prototype,  maybe even a successful pilot.  But here's the harsh reality.  42% of companies abandoned most of their AI initiatives in 2025.  Up from just 17% in 2024.  I mean, that is a huge change.  And according to Rand Corporation research,  over 80% of AI projects fail,  twice the failure rate of non-AI technology projects.  I mean, that's quite astounding.  And if you're wondering why,  well, it's because prototypes don't scale.  When you try to push them to hundreds or thousands of users,  they break.  That is where this role,  this type of skill becomes irreplaceable.  Okay.  The architect,  which is, as I said,  this AI stack engineer is the one who builds systems  that actually work sometimes at enterprise scale,  even if it's not designed for an enterprise user.  The architect's role is to design the backbone,  the data architecture,  the API integrations,  the security frameworks,  the deployment infrastructure.  So if you decide to pursue this,  you'll be the one who takes the proof of concept  and turn it into a production grade system  that can handle real world traffic,  data volumes,  business requirements,  and so on.  And if you're thinking,  oh, that sounds great,  but can't AI do that?  How is this irreplaceable?  Well, because AI is not plug-and-play at scale.  The Rand Corporation study  identified inadequate infrastructure  as one of the five leading causes of AI project failure.  And many times,  companies cited cost overruns,  data privacy concerns,  the security risks as the primary obstacles according to the S&P Global Market Intelligence's  2025 survey of over a thousand enterprises.  But look,  when done right,  the returns are massive.  So I think I read about this company called Lumen Technologies  that projected $50 million in annual savings from AI tools  that saved their sales team four hours per week.  And Air India's AI virtual assistant  handles now 97% of 4 million,  over 4 million customer queries with full automation.  I mean,  clearly there is a use case for this type of skill.  And the market reflects this value.  Enterprise AI architecture projects  typically range from 100,000 to half a million  in mid-market companies.  But you don't have to think about that kind of size, okay?  Ongoing infrastructure management and optimization retainers  run for several thousand dollars per month  according to this article in medium.  Why?  Because the cost of failure is enormous for any size company,  especially for the medium and larger ones.  Companies are literally abandoning millions in AI investments  due to poor architecture.  Now, of course,  these are projects delivered by entire teams,  not a solo engineer.  But this shows,  I think,  the huge potential.  And not only that,  but there are, for example,  loads of jobs  looking for this exact skill set on Upwork, okay?  So here's a quick example  of how a project for this type of skill could look like.  An e-commerce brand wanted to deploy an AI recommendation engine.  And their prototype worked in tests,  but crashed under live traffic.  And then architect, an engineer,  came in, rebuilt the data pipeline,  deployed it on a scalable cloud stack and added monitoring.  And within weeks,  the system not only was stable,  but the company's revenue per customer jumped by 18%.  I mean,  that is the leverage that the architect,  you can bring.  You don't just make AI work,  you make it bulletproof at scale.  So if you're thinking of pursuing something like this,  you need to feel comfortable  providing your client with system architecture design  and cloud infrastructure setup,  whether that's Azure or AWS  or Google Cloud,  you need to be comfortable with API gateway configurations,  with data pipeline engineering,  with security implementation,  with monitoring,  with observability,  with performance optimization,  disaster recovery planning.  You know, that sounds complex.  So if you're new to this and you're wondering,  can I actually learn this in 30 days?  Well, if you have some technical background,  you can,  if you don't and you're completely new to infrastructure,  it will take you longer.  I'm not gonna lie,  but you can start with smaller projects  and then build from there.  So how would I look at the 30 day plan?  Week number one,  I would look at foundations.  I would learn AI infrastructure basics like data,  compute, models,  APIs, security,  and then I would get hands on with cloud,  whether it's Docker,  Azure,  and then deploy a simple AI API wrapper.  Now week number two,  I would start looking into integration and data.  So I would build pipelines and APIs.  I would master ETL and streaming and a GraphQL  and I would add AI specific security.  And then I would deliver a unified secure API  that connects multiple services.  If this sounds like a different language,  probably it gives you a little bit of context  on where you need to start.  If it doesn't,  then let's move to week number three.  And then what I would do,  I would look into monitoring and scaling.  So I would set up observability.  I would optimize performance  with some caching, with CDNs.  I would design disaster recovery.  I think that's super important.  And I would look into scaling strategies  and I'd stress test.  And then week number four,  I would look into real world and business use cases.  I'd develop key studies or model costs or ROI.  And then I'd look at how I could package my offer  or I would start looking for jobs where I could apply.  And as I said,  if this feels a bit too complex for your level of comfort,  this next one is just as impactful  and a lot easier to learn.  Okay, so let's move to lane number four.  Businesses want to automatically engage  with their customers and prospects.  But here's the reality.  Most companies are stuck between expensive custom development  and generic frustrating chatbots  that drive customers away.  And that is why I believe this next skill  is so critical.  I'm calling this one the AI conversation designer.  Okay, so this is the AI agent developer  who builds intelligent conversational systems  that actually work.  And the skill is not just about conversation design  or mocking up UIs.  You are basically the one that actually builds  the chatbots, the voice agents,  the AI-powered customer service systems.  I mean, think VAPI integrations  or custom GPT implementations  or multi-channel conversational AI  or intelligent routing systems  that can handle complex customer interactions.  And if you're thinking,  okay, but why is this role that they're replaceable?  Well, I think it's because while AI models  can generate responses,  they can't architect themselves into functional business systems.  Somebody actually needs to connect the APIs  and design the conversation flows  and integrate with CRMs  and provide knowledge bases and guardrails  and handle edge cases  and make sure the whole system scales reliably.  That is technical work that requires,  in my opinion, human expertise.  But the reality looks different.  Gardner found that chatbot failures  are often based on design problems,  not technical ones.  And in one Ipsos study,  73% of customers reported abandoning  a transaction following a poor chatbot experience.  I mean, the impact for businesses is huge  and that gap is a human problem,  not a tech problem.  In fact, studies have shown  that well implemented conversational AI  can in fact reduce customer service costs  by up to 50%, I think 30 to 50%  while improving satisfaction scores.  I mean, that's massive, right?  And according to medium,  businesses using chatbots in the right way  can increase annual revenue by 7  all the way to 25%.  And clearly companies are desperately trying  to automate customer interactions,  but most lack the technical expertise  to build anything beyond basic FAQ bots.  The market is paying premium rates  for this kind of expertise.  I mean, right now businesses are willing to pay  from a couple thousand to five,  sometimes even six figures per implementation project,  depending obviously on the complexity  on the industry,  on the size of the business  and ultimately the business impact.  And then there are monthly retainers  for maintenance, for optimization,  which can run from a couple hundred  to a couple thousand dollars  according to paramedic.  Because a properly built conversational AI system  can handle thousands of interactions 24 seven  replacing entire customer service teams.  I mean, even Upwork  has tons of job postings  looking for this exact skill set.  Okay, so let me give you an example  so we are clear on what I mean.  There was a fintech startup  that replaced their generic bot  with a carefully designed one  and mapped user intents  and added empathy statement  and built smart escalation triggers.  And within three months,  customer satisfaction scores  jumped 40%  and conversion rates  on upsells also went up.  That must have been worth millions in revenue  all from better conversation design.  So if this sounds exciting,  what you might want to be prepared  to offer your clients  would be customer development,  API integration,  for example, Vapi  or OpenAI  or Twilio  and then multi-channel deployment  like web or phone  or SMS  or WhatsApp  or Telegram  or Slack,  analytics dashboards  and ongoing optimization.  And the beauty of this skill  is that every business  needs customer interaction automation  but most of them  don't have technical expertise  to build it themselves.  So you become their go-to expert  for turning customer service  from a cost center  into a competitive advantage.  So if this sounds exciting,  what I would do  for the next 30 days  would be kind of like this.  Week number one,  I would master the core platforms.  I would learn chat GPT,  APIs,  Vapi for voice agent  and at least one chat bot framework  whether that's bot press  or voice flow  or something else.  And then I would build  three basic prototypes.  Then in week two,  I would learn  integration skills.  I would learn how to connect bots  to calendars  or to CRMs  or to HubSpot  or payment systems  like Stripe  or to communication channels  like I said,  WhatsApp business  or Twilio.  And then I would build  two integrated demos.  And then week three  I would focus on advanced features  like sentiment analysis  and intelligent routing  and escalation triggers  and analytics.  And I'd create a comprehensive key study  with before and after metrics  if you are able to access  somebody who's willing to be a guinea pig.  And then week four,  I would package that service  whether it's a complete AI voice  and chat agent implementation  or something else.  And then I would go and pitch it to five  or 10 businesses  that currently have high customer service costs.  And if development is not for you  but you enjoy being involved  in the tech space,  this next one would be  a perfect one to consider.  Okay, so let's move to the fifth lane  because so far  we've talked about strategy,  we've talked about workflows  about conversations,  lots of development,  but not everyone is a fan of coding  or tech development.  So if you see potential  and you don't want to miss it  but you're not that technical yet,  this will be perfect for you.  This is the prototype thinker.  This is a job  that might sound simple  but it's massively powerful.  This is the type of skill set  that helps you turn vague business goals  into working AI prototypes.  You're basically the bridge  between decision makers  and developers  between what the business wants  and what AI can actually do.  And I think this is massively irreplaceable  because AI can generate  a lot of outputs  with the right guidance  but it cannot talk to stakeholders,  it cannot run interviews,  it cannot prioritize features,  it cannot define success metrics.  I mean, it can  but it'll be hard  to actually follow up on them.  And LinkedIn data  shows that AI product management roles  are exploding right now.  And it's not a surprise.  I mean, with so many companies  coming out with their own AI tool  or personalized app  or other AI products,  this is something  that you would expect, right?  And if you look closely,  you will see that the market  is actually rewarding this.  Product managers with AI skills  are charging anywhere  from $60 to $100 an hour  and sometimes are offered  even retainers for the right fit.  I mean, we will show you  a bunch of app work postings  that are proving exactly that.  And I think the value  of the prototype thinker  is that you do  the mental model translation  from business to engineering  and you scout for use cases  and you make ideas real, tangible  and you do that fast.  And if you think, okay,  this sounds great.  I think I'm a good fit  and I would like to pursue this.  What should I go and learn?  Well, week number one  I would study product frameworks  like jobs to be done  and design thinking  and then I will collect  10 real AI use cases.  And then in week number two  I would prototype two ideas  using no code AI tools  like I don't know replete  or rocket  or bubble  or loveable  or whatever you choose.  And then I would run five user tests  to validate assumptions  and document results  in week three  and in week four  I would offer that  as a service  or I would look to get hired  full-time or part-time  on AI projects  because there is so much demand  for something like this right now.  Okay, now let's move  to the next lane  because here's the thing  maybe you're somebody  who is massively creative  and you don't want to lose touch  with that talent  and you still want to get  into tech a little bit  but not too deep.  Well, this skill  I'm calling the Gen AI creator.  This is somebody  who sets the creative direction  and then uses AI as leverage  to multiply ideas  not to replace them.  So imagine being the person  who can design  an entire brand campaign  messaging, visuals, videos  in days instead of months  because AI is your creative team.  So if you're thinking  yeah, but anybody can use mid-journey  what makes this irreplaceable?  Well, it's because AI  can generate content  but it cannot decide  what great looks like.  It cannot know  what will convert  it cannot know  why it will convert  or why it will inspire  the most emotion.  It has no taste  no intuition for story  no sense for brand  and I think Adobe  found that AI tools  boosted creative productivity  by 40%  but companies still need  human directors  to set the tone  to define the narrative  and to decide  what to ship.  So without a Gen AI creator  AI content  will just look like generic noise  you know  and businesses  are paying for this  trust me right now  brands are hiring  AI savvy creative directors  because every company  is drowning in content  but they're starving  for direction.  So I'm going to make sure  to include here  some Upwork examples  so you can see  that even smaller companies  are looking to hire  for something like this.  So here's an example  to bring this home  and hopefully make it  clearer for you.  A consumer brand  partnered with a Jai creator  who used mid journey  for imagery chat GPT  for copy and a few  AI video tools  for storyboard campaign  in less than a month  they shipped what used  to take a full agency  at least three months  and cut costs  by 60%.  The brand called it  their most efficient campaign  ever.  I mean  that is exactly  what you are  able to do  if you're creative  and you know  how to use AI  that's the leverage  of this type of role  you don't replace  creativity with AI  you amplify it.  Okay.  So if you're creative  and you'd like to pursue this  here's what I do  for the next three days  I would first of all  make sure that I'm able  to provide campaign  strategy  brand voice libraries  multimodal content  performance analysis.  So how do you do that  in week number one  I would go ahead  and learn from design  across mediums  for text  for images for video.  Maybe I'd start with chat  GPT and mid journey  but there's a lot of great tools  out there.  Week number two  I would build a brand voice  operating system template  to help me lock in tone  and style  for my clients  and then  obviously I would play with that  and test it enough to make sure  that it does a great job  and then week number three  I would produce a mini campaign  emails socials  I don't know  landing pages  entirely with AI tools  guided by my  or your direction  and then I would look to package  that in week three  and go and pitch it to 5  to 10 clients  but here's the thing  even the best stack  in the world  won't save you  if no one cares.  So lane number seven  I'm calling it the connector  this is somebody  who builds the community  around a product  so that it can actually grow  because even the best  strategy  the cleanest workflows  the smartest bots  the most creative campaigns  and the sharpest products  all of it  collapses  if nobody cares  so pretty much  any brand needs  lane seven  the connector  the community architect  and the role of  this type of person  or this type of skill set  is to design the human layer  around their products  and businesses  you don't just build technology  you build trust  belonging  and momentum  because I think the truth  is that  people don't want tools  you know  they want to feel part of something  they want to feel like  they belong to a community  so what makes this irreplaceable  I mean clearly  a I cannot replace community  okay community  cannot be automated  in fact  a recent study  that I came across  showed that  60% of people  can spot  a I generated engagement  and if customers  feel that they're just talking to bots  they will at some point disengage  so if you look closely  what they want  is a space to connect  with other humans  guided by someone  who knows how to architect  that experience  and the money is there  right don't get me wrong  brands are paying  top dollar  for community launches  and then they're paying  upwards of a thousand  sometimes more per month  for ongoing community management  and events  and I'm going to make sure to  include some upper job postings  here  to show you  that there is demand  for school  community managers  for other  type of community managers  because  I mean  communities  driver attention  they drive referrals  they drive long term brand equity  in a way that adds  I believe never will  so let me give you an example  to bring this home  there was a software company  that launched a new AI tool  but their marketing  didn't perform as expected  and then a community architect  stepped in  built a private slack group  and created a weekly expert Q&A  and ran two virtual events  in the first 60 days  and within three months  churn dropped by 25%  and referrals spiked  I mean the community became  their growth engine  after that  so you can see  the huge impact  that an engaged  honest human community  can have on a business  that is the power  of the connector  you build an ecosystem  that makes everything else  stick  so if this sounds exciting  what you would need to be able  to provide your clients with  would be strategy platform setup  whether it's slack  or circle  or school  or discord  an engagement calendar  moderation  analytics  events  and I think it's  not necessarily hard  to get started with this  in 30 days  so for example  in week one  you could look into  all the free resources  that exist here on YouTube  in school  even courses  to understand more  about communities  and running communities  in week two  you can audit three  thriving online communities  and then document  what works  and then week three  you could look into building  I don't know  six to eight weeks  engagement calendar  for your favorite community  and if you can  present that to them  and then week four  offer a community launch  in 30 days package  for your favorite influencers  who don't have a community  All right  so this completes our map  the seven lanes  but remember  the point isn't to master  all of them  that's ego  okay  so don't do that  it will just slow you down  the point is to pick one  master it  and monetize it fast  while demand is high  and then you can partner  with people  in the other lanes  so that you can move faster  together  that is how you become  truly irreplaceable  now if you want to figure out  which one is best for you  we have actually created  a very simple quiz  completely free  that you can come and take  in the school community  I hope we remember  to put the QR code here  and then we've also put together  a free ebook  that will show you  for each one of these seven lanes  the exact step by step  30 day learning program  including links to some  of the courses that we have taken  or we have good references for  and that you can go and take  not all the courses are free  just to be very clear  some are many are not  or some are not  but I think it'll at least  give you a great indication  of how to spend those next 30 days  in order to make sure that you maximize  your impact  and you're able to get out there  as fast as possible  alright you guys  that was it for today  thank you so so much for watching  I really hope this was useful  I really hope that it gave you some ideas  about what you can do next  to make yourself irreplaceable  like this video  if you did be sure to

            "resumo": "O vídeo defende que, com IA, as pessoas devem mirar em habilidades de alto valor para se manterem irreplacáveis. Destaque inicial para o estrategista visionário: não apenas sugerir produtos, mas desenhar a arquitetura de decisão, definir o que automatizar, quais métodos usar e como gerenciar riscos, governança e financiamento dentro do negócio. Segundo o apresentador, 85% dos projetos de IA falham por falta de estratégia, e clientes pagam por confiança e por alguém que possa conduzir a implementação com ROI. Um case citado é IBM+BCG: transformação de IA que resultou em 3,5 bilhões de dólares em custo salvo e 50% de ganho de produtividade em dois anos. O plano de 30 dias para virar estrategista visionário é dividir em quatro semanas: leitura de indústria, modelagem de ROI e riscos, mock audits, e lançamento de oferta com roadmap; execução é essencial.",
