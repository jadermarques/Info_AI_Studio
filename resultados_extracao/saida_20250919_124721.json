          "transcript": "I've got something really exciting that I've been exploring recently that I want to share with you. It's all about creating aic experiences with something called AGUI. Now, let me set the stage for you a bit first. There's a good chance that you're stuck on the idea that we need to be building apps or SAS platforms around our AI agents. But that isn't where the future is headed. The real shift is embedding agents into our applications so they become a natural part of the product experience. And it seems natural, right? I mean, when the AI height bubble bursts, the products that are going to be left over are generally not going to be the ones competing as agents, but instead the ones that deeply integrate AI agents into a product that delivers its own unique value. That's what I mean by agentic experiences and the future of SAS because these platforms are the ones that are not going to be wiped out as our more general agents like chat GP and operator get more powerful and make the more niche agents just simply irrelevant. So right now I'll introduce you to how to build these kinds of agentic experiences which are not trivial by the way generally a lot harder than building isolated chat bots. But luckily I have the tech stack for you to make it simple. So, I'll introduce you to that, get into some demos and really important principles, and then we'll build together. I'll even take an agent that I've created previously on my channel and create a full application around it. So, the primary part of our tech stack here is a protocol developed by the C-pilot Kit team called AGUI. I covered it on my channel around when it first came out. Super powerful stuff. Now, the big question is, what does this actually do for us? Well, simply put, AGUI standardizes how front-end applications connect to AI agents. It's like MCP, but instead of connecting agents to tools, we are connecting agents to our applications in a standard way. It's fully open source. So, they have this GitHub repo, which I'll link to in the description. They have a nice diagram here that shows how it works at a high level as well. So we have AGUI kind of as a middleman here that provides a standard of communication between our front-end applications and our AI agents. And so as long as both have support for AGUI, which all of these AI agent frameworks do, then we have the seamless communication that makes it so we can build full applications in hundreds of lines of code instead of thousands and thousands. And that's what we'll see as we build together and go through some of these demos. And so we just have to pick our front-end library and our AI agent framework. And then AGUI takes care of a lot of things. And so for our front end, we're going to be using Copilot Kit. This is a React library that makes it very easy for us to build userfacing agentic applications. It integrates natively with AGUI, of course. And then out of all the options we have for our AI agent framework, you know, if you've been following my channel that paid AI is my favorite. And they recently added a direct firstparty integration between Copilot Kit and Pideantkai through AGUI. They even have an AGUI doc section in Pideant AAI. So, I'm super excited for this. This is actually the catalyst for me to make this video and I've been talking to the Copilot Kit team about this and actually asking for this integration. So, I'm super excited that it's finally here because now we can build these kinds of user interactive applications with Pyantic AI agents under the hood driving the whole thing. And these are the demos that they have for us that I was talking about earlier. I'll link to this in the description. It's a great resource to just explore the power of AGUI. So, they have all of these different demos that each represent something that would very much not be trivial to build without AGUI. But with AGUI, it's really easy. You can even see the code for both the front end like with copilot kit here and the back end like I have padantic AI selected here but you can even just select any AI agent framework you want and it'll immediately drop that in in the back end and then we have to change nothing in the front end that's what agui gives us that standard communication so we can move from langraph to eggno or eggno to panty and our front end app doesn't have to change at all so let's actually see this in action like I want you to see how this really does unlock a entic experiences for us. Like in this example right here, it is a recipe builder and there's a state sync between our front end and our backend thanks to AGUI. So like for example, I can add an ingredient here and I can say I'm adding in beef, one pound of beef. And then I can ask my agent, what are my ingredients? And it's going to immediately recognize the changes that I made in the front end here because we have that two-way sync. There we go. We got our ingredients. And then I can do the other way around. And I can say I want to make a recipe with a lot of beef. All right. So now instead of syncing the front end to the the backend agent, it's now the agent that's going to be updating our front end here. So it's creating the recipe and boom, it renders out everything in a very beautiful way in the front end. So we have our typical chat application on the right hand side, but then it's deeply integrated into the rest of the components of our front end. That's what I mean by aentic experiences. Really, really nice. We have our instructions here. We can actually improve it with AI as well. We have our list of ingredients and I can continue to collaborate with the agent here making changes back and forth to make my perfect recipe. And obviously it's just a very simple example here. But yeah, definitely play around with these different things like human in the loop collaborating with our agent toolbased generative UI. So we can actually build tools in our front end that we give into our AI agent dynamically. There's so many powerful things here. And like I said, we can view the code. So we can see exactly how the front end was built with Copilot Kit and how the back end was built with the Pantic AI agent. All right, so now that you know how AGUI works and what it really gives us, let's get into actually building with it. So the easiest way to get started with building these Aente experiences with AGUI is to follow this quick start, which I'll link to in the description. And so this is the copilot kit documentation and they have an entire section for working with paidantic AI specifically and they do that for all of their integrations. It's really really cool. And so to get started we just have to have mpm installed on our machine and we can copy this command here. So I'll actually go into my terminal and let's walk through this really quickly. So, it's going to set up a new project for us using Copilot Kit as the front end. And then we're using AGUI here. And we can select our agent framework. And so, I'll just say test here because I have something else set up already that I'll demo for you. And there we go. We can select our framework. Like I can say I want to use Pinantic AI. There we go. And so, it's going to open up your browser for authentication because there is a cloud version of Copilot Kit. We don't actually have to pay for anything though. Um, and so we can just get through this and authenticate and then I'll come back once I have this done. Okay, there we go. So, I'm signed in. It creates a Copilot kit cloud API key as well if you want to host with them. You don't have to though. And so, for demonstration purposes, we're not going to be doing anything with that right now, but yeah, they even give us some documentation here. And so, we can open this new folder that was created for us. And so, I have it open right now. And then there's a readme here that walks you through the quick start. to how you can get things set up in both the front end and the back end. And it's literally just a couple of commands. Like it's so easy to get this up and running. And that's going to give us a quick start that's going to look kind of like the demos that we saw here. But now we have something that is running entirely locally. And there's a couple of different things we can try to really see the power of AGUI. And we can start to build on top of this application as well. But I'll just show you really quickly. Like for example, I can say set the theme to green. And so this is a tool that we actually build in the front end and send into our agent. So our backend agent, thanks to AGUI, doesn't even have to know that there's a tool to change the theme. And we just pass that in from the front end. I can also say write a proverb about the difficulties of SQL. All right. So we'll send this in. It'll make a proverb for us. And then boom, we immediately have that state sync like that other demo I was showing you where now our front end has this proverb here. And it's displayed and rendered out in a nice rain. I can say write another one. And so we can do another state sync here. And then I can delete one of these as well. Like I'll just delete this first one. And I'll say I deleted one which is left. Right? So we can know that the front end is also syncing back to the back end as well. And then the last thing that they have for the demo here. I'm just trying to like show you the different kinds of things that we can do with this front end. It's really, really neat. We can also render out components in our chat UI. So, we're not limited to just having a bland conversation here and then passing things into the rest of our app. We can also render out cool things here. So, I can say, uh, what is the weather in Orlando, Florida? And it's going to render out a really nice looking card here. So we can take tool calls from the back end and standardize the format like actually make it look like a nice component in our React frontend. So super cool. That's what we have for our quick demo here. But now let's actually use this as a starting point to build our own applications on top. Now to build on top of this application, we're not going to dive straight into implementation. There's one really cool thing first because the co-pilot kit team, they have built a vibe coding MCP server. Now, you know that I'm not the biggest fan of vibe coding. So, maybe this isn't the best name for what I'm about to use it for, but this is an MCP server that's kind of like archon for knowledge retrieval. It gives our AI coding assistant the ability to search through the co-pilot kit and AGUI documentation and best practices. So it becomes our expert guide on our implementation. Super cool. So if you're building any kind of agentic experiences with this tech stack, definitely use this MCP server. That's what I'm going to be using right now. And they have instructions here based on your AI coding assistant like cursor or client or windsurf exactly how to hook it up. Now they don't have instructions here for claude code specifically. Uh but I've got that for you right now. So you can copy this URL right here and then go into your editor. I have my terminal open here and I'll just paste the command right here. So it's claude MCP ad and then SSE is their transport and then you just can call this server whatever you want and then the SSSE URL is the one that we copied from the documentation. So I'll add that in here and then I can also do a claude MCP list to test the connection and so this is a remote MCP server completely free to use. Now Claude Code is able to search the C-pilot kit documentation. Super cool. Okay, so now armed with this MCP server, we can now build any kind of agentic experience that we want on top of this starter template. It provides a really good foundation for us. And so yeah, I'll send in a request here. I'll show you what it looks like to build on top. And then I'll even show you how far I went taking a rag AI agent that I built with Podantic AI on my channel previously, and I'll show you how I built a full application around it with a GUI. So, we'll get there in a second, but right now I just want to send in a simple request here. I'll and first I'll actually tell it to use the uh copilot kit MCP server to understand how to build this feature. And maybe I don't have to call that out explicitly, but I just want to to make sure that it leverages the MCP. So, what I want to do here, if I go within the source and page.tsx, one of the things we have here is the co-pilot kit action. This is our front-end tool that we're passing into our agent to give it the ability to change the theme. And so I want to add another tool here to do something else. Let's say maybe clear all the proverbs that we have on the front end. I think that's a good example here. So I'll say I want to make another uh front-end tool with co-pilot kit to clear the proverbs that we currently have. And so we since we have that state sync as well, the agent will immediately recognize that everything is cleared in the front end. And so I'm going to go ahead and send this in right now. And it should after maybe looking at some of the files we have in um our starter template here or actually yeah right away it searches the copilot kit docs. Take a look at that. Use copilot kit action custom actions front end. And we can do control O to expand and actually see the chunks or the snippets as they call them that were retrieved from this rag implementation. It's really, really cool. So, we're pulling in the documentation from C-pilot kit. That's a part of our context engineering here, giving our coding assistant all the information it needs to actually build out the implementation here. Now, this is a very simple example. And so, it could probably just look at what we already have for a front-end tool and then implement that as well. But I hope that you can see that like if we didn't have any front-end tools at all, it would have no idea how to use use copilot kit action. So, it would need to search through the documentation like we are doing here. And so, yeah, let me actually scroll down. Um, let me exit out of this. There we go. All right. Yeah, there we go. It is adding in a clear all proverb tool. And so, when this is invoked from our agent, it's going to yeah, just clear the proverbs in the state that we have and that'll immediately be synced to the backend as well. Looking really, really nice. So, cool. Yeah, I'll pause and come back once this is fully fully implemented. There we go. I just paused for like 20 seconds and then we are done. So we have that new action and then we just have the button that it added for us to be able to clear things right here. So there we go. We got our updated UI. So now I can say add a bunch of proverbs. All right. So we'll have to populate it first obviously. So the agent has generated some proverbs. There we go. We have Oh wow. It is adding a lot. All right. So we added a lot of proverbs here. And now I can clear all of them. And so I'm going to send this in. Click this button here. Or I could just ask it to clear the proverbs. So, well, I'm actually going to click this button here, clear all proverbs. Uh, there we go. And now we have that state sync. And so, I can say, what proverbs do I have? And it's going to say that there are none. There we go. It is currently empty. And I can also show you. So, I'm going to say add some more. I'll also show you that like I can have the agent clear them as well. So, it doesn't just have to be this button. So, I can say clear the proverbs. And so just based on a simple text request to our agent, we can do the same thing that that button did. And so I hope that this just helps you see how our agent is starting to interact with the website. We can build these agentic experiences where AI agents can actually help us navigate through a website as well. Like this is a really simple example where it performs an action of a button click, but this could be a full onboarding experience where the agent is actually like walking me through clicking on different buttons in my app depending on what I'm talking to it about. Like, oh, I have this question and then it's like, okay, well, let me click on this button and then highlight this section of a website. Like, there's just so many things that we can do with this. And so, that that's like the higher level principles that I wanted to be speaking to in this video. Like it's cool to like see AGUI and Panti specifically, but like the most important thing that I'm trying to get across here is the general principles of like we need a way to sync the state between the front end and the back end. The agent needs to know like where we're currently at in our front end. And that is what AGUI makes really easy for us along with the fact of course that our backend is so incredibly simple thanks to AGUI. Generally, you'd have to build an entire backend with API endpoints and middleware and everything. But our backend right now is literally just a single file. We have our agent.py. And so this is our Pantic AI agent where we have our agent defined. We're giving it some tools. It's going to look very similar for uh other frameworks as well. We have our primary system prompt. And then the only thing we have to do to turn this padantic AI agent into a fully working API endpoint compatible with AGUI and our C-pilot kit front end is to call this two AGUI function. So so easy. And so now our agent is running on port 8000 and it is good to go. And we have everything handled here with the state syncing and conversation history. We can even dynamically adjust the system prompt based on the front end. There's so much integration that we have here for literally 100 lines of code. like this is just so so easy. And so there are a lot of things that are made possible thanks to AGUI. Not because we couldn't build it without the protocol, but because it just makes it so easy to do so. And it's the same kind of thing with like the model context protocol. I mean, we can connect agents to any tools, but MCP just makes it very easy and accessible. That's what we have here. And like I said I would cover, I even went as far as to take an existing Pantic AI agent that I built on my channel previously and create a full application around it with AGUI and Copilot Kit. And that's what you're looking at right here. And so I'll link to the video right here where I built this rag agent. I built it with cloud code and a team of sub agents. And in that video we were just using the command line, a simple CLI tool to talk to our agent. So it was a perfect opportunity to take an existing agent and barely having to change the code at all thanks to the padantic AI and AGUI integration to build out this full app. And so now I can ask it a question. It's a rag agent. So we have this knowledge base with all this information about AI startup. So I can ask it about OpenAI's funding for example. And we'll get the answer on the right hand side like a normal chatbot. It's got streaming and conversation history and everything. But then also it takes all of the chunks that we returned from the knowledge base and it populates the front end with them. So we have this super interactive rag agent where we can actually like view the chunks that it retrieved. We can see the match percentage. We can click in to view the contents of the chunks and all the metadata like the document that it came from. I mean this is definitely taking a typical rag agent that you would have in just a chat interface. taking it to the next level where we can actually see under the hood what information it's using to give us the answer that we have in the chat box. So really really cool and man was it easy to build this out. I'll just show you the code really quickly here. I had to define some classes here. That's for the state sync so that the chunks that we have in the front end is synced with what the agent knows it's displaying. And then I defined my agent very very much the same way like I always do with padantic AI giving it tools as well to search my knowledge base both with semantic search and hybrid search like a keyword search. And so I'll scroll down here. We have the system prompt as well. Um this is also dynamic. So all of the chunks that we have as a part of that state sync through agui we're passing those in as a part of the system prompt. And then all I have to do just like our starter template is call the rag agent.2 to agui and now we have the full backend infrastructure spun up with the agent running on a port 8000. Absolutely beautiful. And we could swap this out for a langraph agent and not even have to change the front end at all. That is the beauty of AGUI. And to build all of this, all I did is I followed the quick start here in the copilot kit documentation for Pantic AI. They have instructions specifically for how you can take an existing Pantic AI agent and turn it into something that's compatible with AGUI. So I I use this as a reference point. And then I went into Cloud Code. I took that starter template that I already showed you building on top of, put in the code for my existing agent, hooked in the vibe coding MCP server and just had it go ham. So yeah, using the MCP for documentation and then the existing template to build on top of, I just told it exactly what I wanted. I want you to take the copilot kit application, make it work with this rag agent so I can actually see the chunks and all the metadata and it knocked it out of the park. It was so easy to build this out. So there you have it. That is everything you need to know to get started building agentic experiences with AGUI. Now here's the thing. Pyantic AI, AGUI, Copilot Kit, these are just tools to get the job done. The higher level principles are what I really want you to focus on. things that I covered here like human in the loop and front-end tools and state syncing. That's what you really need to make these agentic experiences. AGUI is just the protocol to standardize things and make it that much easier to build out this kind of application. Like I literally built this out in like a half hour after I brought in my existing agent. It was so easy to do this with the help of an AI coding assistant. So there you go. If you appreciated this video and you're looking forward to more things AI agents and AI coding, I would really appreciate a like and a subscribe.",

          "transcript": "Can you vive code an entire ecom store? Claude code with codeex design docker and player mcp. Can we make an entire ecom website from just a CSV? Let's find out together. So, I'm going to be using Woo Commerce. I actually didn't really like Woo Commerce until I had to add it to SEO growth. Now that I've actually used it a little bit, it's really interesting. Now, just before we continue, if you need any help with your SEO and you're on either Woo Commerce or Shopify, this video is sponsored by SEO Growth. SEO.ai. It's a SAS that will grow your store automatically. You can still join the wait list. There's still the special offer for our founding members, which is $99 for 3 months. Sorry, $99 a month for 3 months and then going up to $499. But yeah, basically I didn't actually realize this, but Woo Commerce is pretty damn interesting. So, what I've done is I basically just found this, which is um a load of products on uh GitHub, right? It's just an example CSV. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to see if I can make an entire website from it. So, let's just open up terminal because I just turned my computer off for the first time in a while. And let's zoom in a little bit here. And actually, we need Visual Studio Code as well. And I'll just do a new window. Yep, sure. And then file, open folder. I really need to learn how to do this without doing it manually. And we'll call this uh WordPress woocom because that's just what came into my mind. And then open that folder. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use codeex for the design here. And then I'm going to use um claw code to create the thing. So, I'm really curious to see just how good or how well this is going to work. So, let's start by giving Codeex the CSV, which obviously it doesn't accept it. So, let's go here instead. And I'm going to say, \"Please design me a homepage, a full homepage with as many design elements as possible for an ecom store selling the following products. You can use image links to really show the quality and modernity of your build. Just use HTML, CSS, JavaScript. There we go. And then I'll send the products. So, while Codeex fires up, let's actually set up Claude Code as well. The reason I'm using claude code, by the way, is because it's much better at using Docker and things like that. And also just generally it's just much better with um it's much better with uh WordPress basically. So let's CD inside uh what did I call this? WordPress com. There we go. And then let's do let's add the playright MCP first of all. So Google Right. MCP. There we go. And we'll just add this. Okay. Uh, do we need any other MCPS? I don't think so. Okay. So, uh, inside Oh, wait. Claude D- dangerously skip permissions. Okay. create a new folder called um ecom site and then inside that start a fresh docker instance uh with WordPress for development and web commerce installed. There we go. And we'll send that. So let's just check out what's going on here. Okay, it's still just doing stuff. That's fine. Let's actually just open Docker as well. Someone said that the main flex is that your Docker started in such a short amount of time. I have one of the new Macs, guys. That's probably why. I think I could run LLMs on this thing, honestly. But I think I I think when all of these active, I think I was just using 60 GB of RAM or something before I turned my computer off. Jesus. No wonder, man. No wonder it froze yesterday while I was playing League of Legends. I think that's probably on me. Okay, so we should actually just Yeah, we can basically open this already. I'm I'm going to install everything. I'm going to show you guys everything that I actually do here. So, the containers are running. Let's wait a moment for WordPress to fully initialize, then set it up. So, I'm just waiting for it to set it up for me. You could run through this manually, but I'm just going to let it do, you know, uh I'm going to let it do it itself. This is what I use claude code for, right? I just kind of want to demonstrate what I use claude code for. Um, and it's it's mainly stuff like this. Like if I want to really if so I've said just install the CLI there. So you I do keep an eye on it, right? So it said here that uh WordPress image blah blah blah doesn't have it uh installed by default. Let's install WordPress through but I don't like that. So I said just install the WordPress CLI because I want to use the WordPress CLI. So this is the kind of stuff I use it for. any shell commands, any annoying thing, MCPs, Docker, that kind of stuff, you're going to run run into huge problems trying to do that, right? If you do it with um if you do it with codecs, right? And then codeex raw power and raw ability to code is really really nice. Okay, so let's have a look. Why does it say failed? Okay, interesting. Let's just put it all in an index.html file. Okay. So, this is the the design that um Codex came out with, which is really really nice actually. Super super good. So, can we turn this into a WordPress website with one prompt? That's the question. This is this is actually insane. If I can if I can do this. This looks really, really nice. I think it could even be I think it could be even better, but like I mean compared to what you would normally get from AI, this is pretty insane. I would change the header person and stuff like that, but let's just let's just go with the flow here, right? So, there we go. WordPress is now set up. Oh, let's go to Docker. Sorry. So, let's open this. There we go. It's got uh Woo Commerce because you can see it has a checkout. Uh, let's just check what the username and password is. Sorry for flicking around. Admin. So, let's just copy the password. Okay. So, let's go to slash WordPress admin and then admin and then log in. I'm sorry, I'm not one prompting this. I'm vi coding this, I should say. Okay, so we're in. Let's see. Uh, themes. Where is themes? Appearance themes. Okay, so there's no theme or anything like that. That's fine. Okay, so let's first of all let's just attach this CSV and let's just say add these products either via CLI curl or um import CSV whatever just get them on my site right um I would personally say if you've got a lot of products do it via um uh CSV import I would say that's probably the best way to do it but if you've just got 10 products looks like this, then you can also just let it do it semianually, right? Okay. So, let's just see if this this works. It's basically created a Python script. It's converted 20 products from Shopify to Woo Commerce format. And then it should theoretically just import them all, right? So, you get maybe you can kind of see where I'm coming from, guys, but I'm very excited about this because like I didn't even know this was possible until very recently. So, can we create basically an entire business in 10 minutes? Now, that's kind of kind of the question I'm asking today, right? Okay. So, let me install a CSV importer. So, you would have had to do all this yourselves. You would have, you know, blah blah blah. I'm just sat back relaxing, feet up, and it's just doing it right now. I could just technically take this CSV that I created and just import it. So, I might just quickly see if that works. just cuz I'm curious. So, let's search for this and then wait. So, am I Yeah. Okay. Search for that. Then, can I drag this there? No. Okay. So, I just uh selected it here. Let's just see if this works. Run the importer. Your products are now being imported. Okay. So, it says 20 products imported. There we go. So, I mean, that still saved me a lot of time, right? I didn't even have to convert the files myself. And then instead of it doing that, I said, so I'll just say I just uh imported them through the admin. Can you check you have the products? So this is what the website currently looks like now that it has products, right? It's pretty obviously it it's basic, but this is kind of manu. This is automatically created by the theme, right? The product page. So there we go. It can see the products. Uh, WPWC product list. There we go. No, I don't care about that. Okay. So, now I want you to So, what I would do at this stage is I'm just going to say I want you to I don't know why it's I don't know what's wrong with my Mac recently. So, I want you to create five categories and assign products to them and then put let's just do that. I just want some categories um or for two reasons. Number one, you guys should always have categories. So, I'm just showing you that this is an important part of the process. And number two is I want them because I want to be able to display categories on the homepage and it's part of the design and therefore I just have to quickly also create some categories. Now you can see it's super super easy. It just created five categories for me in like literally 1 second. Um so if I go to categories, we should see some categories here. And now it's going to assign the products. So we'll see that in a second as well. Now, let me assign products to their appropriate categories. So, I'm basically just creating an entire business. Right now, the the main thing is can it take the design index.html and turn it into a full-blown website? That's kind of that would be the exciting thing to see. So, there we go. We now have some actual SEOable stuff. We have some categories. We have some stuff. I've been doing this for like 10 minutes, guys, and I've already got, you know, the bare bones of an entire website. Okay, so that worked good. Okay, now take the design in index.html inside your root directory, not inside uh what was it called? ecom site and use it to precisely to create a web press ecom website around that design. Um, yeah, I mean, let's just keep it simple. There we go. Wait, ultra thing here. I'm just going to say ultra think here because I have a theory that one of the reasons Codeex is so much better and Claude Code has degenerated so much is that we're not actually giving it the time to think. Right. Okay. So, seems they want me to think deeply about this. There we go. So, now I'll let this run. Uh, it's just read 1,457 lines of code. I just want to see what it actually says here. I want to see if it says it's like a manageable task or if it's going to have problems or whatever it might be. And then literally you would just add some blogs and you'd be pretty much done. This is a beautiful modern e-commerce design for rustic aura home and garden furniture decor store. The design features color scheme uh key sections interactive elements. Now I need to convert this into a WordPress theme with Woo Commerce integration. This will involve creating custom theme, converting HTML into WordPress PHP templates, marking the products dynamic using Yeah, perfect. This is exactly what I want it to do. And yeah, I could literally just go to sleep right now and hopefully wake up with a full e-commerce store. Obviously, I'd need to add things like a contact page and you know, all that, but I mean, yeah, we'll see how this does. Okay, so it's currently testing it and I just want to kind of show you guys this process. So, this is what we've got. You can see it's I'm just going to I'm just going to pause it. Actually, normally I just let it test, but I just want to see Wow. Um, this is pretty mad, guys. I I It was That That was 6 minutes. That is That is crazy. That is crazy. That was about 20 minutes in total to make this entire store. I I honestly am blown away. I'm blown away. I can't believe this is possible. I mean, it still needs a tiny bit of work. Obviously, it's not completely perfect, but I did stop it early. Um, yeah, with a little bit more prompting, guys. Like, this was simple prompting. So imagine this with a complicated prompt where you're really, you know, going at it to do all the SEO and, you know, blah blah blah make, you know, do a popup and you guys, this is this is crazy. Holy So yeah, guys, if you do end up uh using this, definitely check out segrow.ai AI if you need the SEO done for it like on a more consistent basis or honestly just vibe code it yourselves. Yeah. Uh I'm going to leave the video there guys. This is an absolute game changer. I'm not going to lie. Like you can literally just generate an entire beautiful looking ecom store in under 20 minutes which I did not think I did not have that on my bingo card. Thanks for watching guys. If you're watching all the way to the end of the video as usual you're an absolute legend and I'll see you very very soon with some more content. Holy crap. Peace out.",

          "transcript": "Hey guys, I wanted to talk about something today and I'm actually doing I'm currently running another benchmark as we speak, but I wanted to talk about how in my opinion like replet is probably done to be honest with you because I mean yeah it will always have a space and a place in people's hearts and things but just like the what's the point in this right if you can literally just say to codeex so I just ran this prompt how do you feel about making me an entire SAS I just want a homepage that looks incredibly modern, a dashboard, the five side options, the tool should be a basic AI powered CRM, blah blah blah. And it just went straight into it and it just started creating it. And now I'm just sitting and waiting to see what it actually produces. And what's the difference, right? Why would you even use replay anymore when replay is way more expensive? This might seem fairly cheap, but like you do not get like infinite usage for this. You can see pay as you go for additional usage. Pay as you go for additional usage. So you will end up paying a lot more money than you might think because you will have to use this a lot if you're creating an entire SAS. Now Codex on the other hand I am pretty sure that I'm just using my Codeex 20 bucks subscription as far as I know. Income stream Surfer Income Stream Surfer is a pro account. I'm fairly sure. Yeah. So I'm paying 23 bucks a month and I'm using Codeex and I haven't once had to I've never got rate limited nothing like and I've been using it a lot. It's not like I just use it a tiny bit. I've been using it for for Grove. I've been using it for videos. I've probably built like three different websites already and I still haven't hit any rate limits. So, I'm just starting to think like where does Replet and where does Lovable and where did Bolt even sit on this? Like what what do they do that's special? They can run your code for you. What? You can't run npm rundev so you have to pay pay as you go usage and frankly kind of ridiculous prices once you get up there. Like I remember we were paying I I think 75 bucks a month for level 50 maybe. Um and yeah it just like what do they actually do? You can connect superbase. Great. You can connect to GitHub. Wow. Like what what are we doing here? I don't know. It's weird. I I will say one thing though. This did get me into generation like bolt new and stuff. But as soon as I saw it I was like this isn't doing anything special. And now it's getting to the point where you can just prompt your own AI and just say, \"There you go, mate. Off you go. Make this for me and then, yeah, come back in a few hours.\" Now, this is the thing that really got me interested when I was I was reading this article yesterday on the on the channel on the video. I saw this here. Codec during testing, we've seen GBC5 codecs work independently for 7 hours at a time on large complex tasks. When I saw this, I thought, \"Holy this is a this is a breakthrough.\" 7 hours at a time. And I've tested this. It didn't do seven hours, obviously. Like, I don't know what the hell they prompted to get it to go for 7 hours, but like I it worked for over an hour for me on uh the example website that I made on yesterday's video. Let's just go on that video real quick. And then I just want to give a little bit of perspective on this um website that I made. So, yeah, I believe this is the correct website notes. Okay, it's this one here. So this is by far the best website I've ever seen generated by AI for sure. It's better than replay. It's better than lovable. It's better than any other. It's better than claw code. It's literally perfect as well. Like if you make this with replay, you will have issues. Something will go wrong, etc., etc. But this is literally perfect code, right? Okay. So this is saying that this is done already. I really don't know how it's managed to finish this already, but I guess we can have a look. Assembled the dashboard with sideboard notification implemented client side CRUD canban rendering auto assign documented local reimmitation. The plan currently simulates responses locally and strategies reen by CLI guidance only. No externals are made because the environment has restricted network access to serve to verify server folder statically. For example, this and open this. Uh okay. can be actually made in a working SAS instead of messing. So, this is what it created for now. Anyway, uh this does look fairly standard to be honest with you. I'm not massively happy with this, but Oh, it's got light mode, dark mode. That's crazy. Really, really cool. So, I'm guessing these are just Yeah, they're just uh anchor links, but I've just asked it to actually implement everything. So, we'll see what happens here. Okay, so again, this says this is done. I'm just going to set the end variables. Okay, so I've done that. Uh, and then for Stripe, it's it's it's not too complicated, guys. Honestly, I'll make a video about this at some point, but it's not as complicated as I thought it was. So, I'm running npm install it. For the stripe variables, you literally just need price ID and you need the developer key, which is if you just click developers down here, uh, and then go overview, then you can get all your keys that you actually need right here. So, secret key is the one that I needed this time. And then you just do stripe login using the CLI. Uh and then you do stripe listen and then you get this wh set key which is here. And then yeah you just that that's everything. Okay. So there's some kind of npm issue here. So I'm just going to grab this and send it to share gt5. Okay. So npm install worked that time. Oh, we got a crash. Oh, already in use 3000. Uh, let's change the port. Okay, so now it's listening at localhost 3006. There we go. So, this should have some functionality now. Sign in. It still doesn't let me. It doesn't let me create an account, but I didn't actually ask it to do that. So, that's okay. Let's have a look. So, let's add a client. So, this is Bob. Bob and MMR is okay. So, it says enter a valid value when I try to enter a number. Okay, so it does let me add a teammate. If I refresh this, does it save? Let's go back to team. It does. Okay, so we do have a database that's working. Open Stripe. Okay, so let's see if it actually implemented Stripe properly. First time. So we're using um if you don't know how this works, guys, we're using fake. Well, not fake, but uh test credit card information. Um and you can actually just see if this works, right? So, let's see if Stripe works first time out the box and then if it does, like what's the point in using replay? I just don't get it. I'd much rather be doing this myself. Okay, so we can see if that actually worked by going here or here. Sorry. Oh, okay. So, charge succeeded, payment method attached, invoice paid. Yeah, so it worked. We got all the Stripe information that we need. So, that'll now be in the database. And the really cool thing is it made a database using SQL Lite and it it automatically gave it persistence because if you're using SQL Lite, you're going to want persistence, right? So add task. Client's not coming up because I can't add a client. Okay, there we go. So we now after a very quick edit, we can now add a client. Let's see if that's saving. It is. So now we should be able to add a task for Bob. Um do SEO for Bob. Due date 18th. There we go. And then we refresh this again. There we go. Interesting. So, this all works. I mean, that's pretty damn impressive. You now have the building blocks to make an entire SAS. Right now, I personally I'm not going to be using this as a SAS. Obviously, I'm not going to make an AI powered CRM as a SAS. But what I am going to do is I'm going to make an AI powered CRM to manage our agency. Right? So, let's just see. Does auto assign do anything? No, it doesn't. But yeah, we we we can very quickly and very easily add new features to this. My idea behind this is basically we need to be able to run our agency using AI, right? That's the plan here. Um, oh, what is this? So, this is for Bob. Do SEO for Bob. Uh, Hish does it. Lol. Generate plan. Okay, it didn't work. Open Rita GBC. Okay, it's incorrect model name. That's fine. So, because I'm kind of getting, you know, decent at coding myself now, I know that I can just search for model here, I can look. And this needs to be open AI, I believe. That's the problem. So, we'll save that and then we'll generate again. Okay, I probably need to refresh. So, draft plan for Bob. Bob, uh, do SEO for Bob. Amish has to do it. generate plan. Uh, ready G. Oh, it's G GT5 me. There we go. That should work. Now, I don't know if it's open router or um open AI. I might have to change that again. Uh, do bot image it. Okay. Damn. So I want to just give a little bit of context before I finish this video. This might seem like a fairly basic task, but I mean people have generated entire um things like context engineering and replit and bolt new and lovable and all those things to create something that now can just be done by it can literally be done by codeex in half an hour. This is the fastest I've ever made one of these. Now, this was actually at one point one of my um benchmarks, right? My one of the benchmarks that I did was how can how quickly can you create an entire SAS, right? And now it can do it in half an hour, guys. I mean, honestly, this is this is mad. This is absolutely mad. So, for me personally, I'm not going to be making loads of SAS. I'm going to be making a few internal tools to mean that we can automate a lot of our processes. maybe make a few more SASSes down the road. I'm not sure yet. But if you want to build a SAS, use Codeex right now. It's insanely powerful. I'll leave the video there, guys. Thank you so much for watching. If you're watching all the way to the end of the video, you are an absolute legend. And I'll see you very, very soon with some more content. Peace out.",

          "transcript": "Hey guys, welcome to this video where I'm going to be talking about Codeex versus Claude Code and why it's not actually that clear which one's better. Now, I want to start this off by saying in my opinion, Codeex is better at coding, but Claude Code is better at following workflows, working with external things like MCPs, shell commands, all that good stuff. Now I want to show you a couple of examples. This is an example of a generated WordPress directory. This is by codeex. Now this actually looks better than what Claude code might produce for example, but it's not followed the instructions that I gave it. It should have easily been able to do a curl request on Gina to find therapists in California. If I run the same prompt through Claude code, it would build an entire website. Claude Code, uh, sorry, Codeex, on the other hand, seems to have just got hung up on a few different things. Now, this is still, I would say, an interesting test, but it's not as good as Claude code at doing custom workflows, following custom workflows, etc., etc. So if you want easily repeatable code workflows, I think claude code might actually be better. If you want to interact with external MCPs or just MCPS generally, if you need it to run shell commands, etc., etc., again, I'm going to suggest you you use clawed code. However, if you want raw coding power, then definitely have a look at codeex. Now, this is an example that Codeex did for me, and it basically took something that Claude Code had struggled with for hours and out, no, sorry, weeks and weeks and weeks, and instantly fixed it, and instantly put it in this really nice looking UI UX. Now, this is something I can build off, right? This is what quot which is something that I'm working on for a client will probably look like in the future because to be honest with you, Codeex has done a much better job. And I want to clarify this is GPT5. Codeex has done a much better job at what this plat platform should actually look like. The animations are smooth and perfect. All of the colors are great. It just looks really, really nice. But more importantly, the entire back end actually works. It has a load of tests. It's created a swagger. It's done all of these different really, really interesting things that I needed for this project. And then it built me a UIUX which I could stand behind. I honestly think that this looks like a millionoll app. I know that it's just one tiny portion of it, but you wouldn't be surprised if you paid a lot of money for an app and this is what it actually looked like, right? Whereas something that you make with Claude Code is just not going to look this good. This was actually something that was stuck on with Claude Code for a very, very long time. It was very annoying. It just wasn't working no matter what I did with it. I took it into Codeex and Codeex basically smashed it. But then on on the flip side of that, I take something that even Sonnet 4 completely smashes inside Clawude Code, which is a custom workflow using claw.md, and I I do the same thing with codeex, and it's not it it's complete trash, right? So, it's it's not quite as black and white as people might think as one is better than the other, right? It's it's not clearcut. It's not obvious. It depends what you want to do. I will say right now UIUX, you're going to want to use codeex. Trust me, just use codeex. Don't use claude code for UIUX. For backend code, again, I would use codeex. The kind of things that I would use claude code for, and I'm going to keep pushing this um probably until Enthropic releases a new model, which I think will be very, very soon. They normally do it on Fridays to be honest with you. I'm just going to see if there's any news actually. No. So, and the Claude is now available in Xcode, which is pretty cool. But, um, I'm going to guess 48 hours. I said that before, but yeah, I guess I don't know. I think it will be within a week. Um, we're just not exactly sure when the next model is coming, but I'd be very surprised to not see some kind of big gamechanging update from Anthropic in the next week or so because if they don't, people are going to start going over to to Codeex to be honest with you. Now, one more thing is the pricing, right? Uh I pay 20 bucks a month for Chad GBT and I've never hit any limits. I'm not doing bags of coding at the moment, but I'm doing a decent amount to be honest with you. Whereas Cloud Code, 200 bucks a month, you're going to run out pretty quickly. So, there's obviously the pricing to consider as well. If you need it to run shell commands though, honestly, you're going to need Claw Code. So, my suggestions, my suggestion to people is to have the $20 Claude code plan and the $20 Chad GPT plan instead of one of the $200 plans. I think that's the best thing to do. And then you do half your coding because half of coding is database updates and MCPs and Stripe and APIs and shell commands and all that stuff, you can use claw code. Whereas for kind of UI, UX coding like everything and just basically having complete projects that aren't pre-esigned workflows, then definitely use Codeex. So this is another example. I made this in the last video that I just released, but this is the best version of this website I have seen by far. This was completely done by Codeex. Codeex absolutely smashed this. I I'm still blown away by how good this is now. uh scrolling through it again. So yeah, it really depends what you're doing. Okay, I hope this video helps someone out there. I hope you enjoyed the video. If you're watching all the way to the end of the video, you're an absolute legend. And I'll see you very, very soon with some more content. Peace out.",

And so in this video, I'm going to be breaking down the complete process for any beginner coming into AI to be able to go from zero to $100,000 and the five key challenges that you're going to face along the way and the solution to each of these different roadblocks. Sweet, man. Great to great to see you. I'm so excited to jump into this cuz that 0 to 100K is what everyone's after right now and you've just recently gone through that process. So, we're going to be breaking down um the five key steps that you've got in between here and there. And uh you've got a ton of source in there, guys. If you got don't know Kelly, he's been absolutely crushing it. I've been watching his story for a while now. Came up through my accelerator and he's just been going from strength to strength. The way he's doing his content on LinkedIn, uh the way he's sourcing this like the strategy he approached learning the skills with is actually really really smart as well. So, Michael, mate, it's great to have you on here and I can't wait to to share what you've got to got to share with these guys. or if you just want to give us a bit of a framing on on your journey and how you sort of come to the the realization on a lot on a lot of these before we jump in. So what you see here on the screen is the road to 100k and all the problems that I had to go through along the way and I broke them down into the five key steps five five key milestones that I had to go to get to the 100k because it is one of the most important steps at least for me um to then be able to to go down in different directions but I feel like these cover mainly what most people really go through when they go to uh to build an AI automation agency and so on. Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's uh these are the exact things I I have to answer again and again and again and again on calls. Um, and it's going to be so great for people to see this contextualized of basically taking the playbook that I've been screaming at everyone to do for so long and you giving us the actual screenshots of those messages that you're sending out and the examples of the post you're doing. So, I'm super super excited to jump into this, man. All right. So, the first up here is really just learning AI. So, this is the first milestone when you get into the whole space. I feel like this is where you get the most overwhelmed because you get introduced to all the different tools that are out there. In this case for me, I was introduced to Voppy uh voice flow make.com lovable and again you were one of the YouTubers that I that I was watching over time uh because you were introducing all the different tools and you're talking about the AI automation agency model uh and I was so so excited and when I jumped into the AAA which is where I really got started with the with the whole sort of journey I was introduced to all the different tools and I was overwhelmed because there's so many different things to focus on and I didn't really know what to do at that point. Um and that was that all the time. Exactly. And and that was I mean focus is one of the hardest things to have especially in the space because there's so many things you can do, so many things you can focus on. So for me that was a that was a key step that I had to go through. So what I did for me I actually spent a few weeks diving deep into each software to understand more so the space but also what each software did and the function that it played around how to build a business with it and then through Casey which is one of the success managers at AAA he told me if you just lock in and focus on one thing and that was make.com in that case work for automations and that's the thing that I decided to is jump in. remember I did a video I think it was in like end of um like middle of 2024 or something and it was like the five different ways to start an AI agency and it was basically the same thing. There's these different areas that you can specialize in. There's there's a voice agents. There was like I mean you could even go do Zap Zappia ecosystem and get really good at that. You could just do the workflow part of things. Um or you could do the textbased agents and chat bots. And I think what was really really helpful for a lot of people in the same way that it is for you here to just like cut out the noise and just pick one area because they're all like if you just focus on voice agents you can become very good at them and there's so much money to be created in that space right now. Likewise with workflow automations or if you want to be doing I think the custom software and vibe coding one is a great path to get into as well now. So taking that down from thinking you need to be like a general agency and be able to do everything to just being like this is my area of expertise and and I can learn that stuff which is is so important for beginners to know 100%. And it's so easy to just like focus on all of them because you just you just like you're missing the opportunity if you don't focus on all of them rather than just d each one which is exactly what I felt because I was I was learning everything one day. The interesting thing about workflow automations is is I call it's kind of like the meta skill cuz all you use it across everything. So even if you're building textbased agents you may still be like orchestrating that with with a with a workflow platform like make. Um, or if you're doing voice agents, you might be doing your tools on something like uh like make or you might be doing it on NA10 and the same kind of transferable skills. So, I still think that workflow automation base is is really really solid. 100%. Especially as someone who came in with no technical knowledge. I think the fundamental skill here is like APIs, understanding how apps talk to each other. And the skill you're learning is not make.com, it's workflow automations. And that's something you use across the whole board. Uh so that's and understanding how like software talks to each other like APIs is is the core of everything we do these days um across all even if you're putting custom software on lovable it's like okay well I've got this cool looking front end how am I going to get it to do anything okay well I understand that my my automations would have to send API requests around so maybe I can get some workflow automation or like some uh some tool that I create and then hook it into our API and it's just like everything is built on top of of that ability 100% I think that's something you you learn over time like what fundamental skills you actually need to learn. Uh but that was really really key for me. So what I did essentially was just niche down as much as possible. AI automation was is already a niche within AI to niche down to one subset of AI automation which is work for automations. And to be able to learn these tools um people over complicate this. They think they need a course. They think they need to find some some fancy software to go out there and learn these tools. But what I learned is just YouTube is the best place that you can probably learn all these all these sort of softwares and stuff. Nowadays as well there's so much of this content around on YouTube now. like the the amount of AI automation training content. I put out full courses here on the channel um on basically everything the AI agents, AI automations and vibe coding and all these things. I have full courses and then every there's channels that are just specialized in each of these different areas as well. So if it's like oh I haven't got the money to start this, it's just it's just not even an excuse anymore. 100% 100%. Especially for me cuz I literally had zero had zero dollars. And by the way, just so you know, like when I joined the accelerator, I didn't have any money. I asked my sister to give me 80% of what she had and my dad as well and I put it onto the accelerator and I went full in all in all in um and that that was that was the key for me and the thing that actually got me started as well was your chap videos like you were posting chap videos on voice flow. So that was the thing I found on YouTube as well that you can just simply just learn and just get going right away. So the second step here after learning AI and getting started once you know your sort of niche within the AI automation space you know that you're doing work for automations then it's about how can we get our first client clients right and for me at the start initially it was just about working for free for the first three clients before actually pricing any client before asking for money uh and for me it's just because of experience that I wanted to get but also just to get going getting the momentum going I feel like early on you want some quick wins you want something to to keep you going uh because that keeps you motivated and so on. Yeah, 100%. I mean, the free the free strategy, I get into a bit of a a difficult situation with some people like obviously you're young, you've got you've got time on your hands, you've got energy, and you wanted to do the fundamentals and learn learn from the ground up. When there's other side of the auto AI automation space or or people wanting to get into AI businesses are people with jobs and they want to do it as a side hustle and they want to come in and not necessarily do all that ground work and have like a really solid skills base. So, it's it's always a bit tricky whether for younger people like us or maybe people who are time rich. uh definitely doing all the learning, the fundamentals, and then working your way up through free clients to paid clients. It's just a very logical progression. Uh but then some people do come in and say, \"Oh, I don't really want to do all of that work. I'd rather just kind of be the be the connector or be the marketer.\" And that is that is possible, but this is definitely like 100% the the guaranteed way. I call it like the the slow way to get rich with AI is to do this path to learn the fundamentals and like you will absolutely get there. Um but it might not be as rapid as as you expect because you do have to go through free clients gradually increase your prices. Um which is exactly what you've done. I mean it's just doing the unscalable before you scale right and for me it was like 19 team with so much time like you mentioned no responsibilities. I've talked to 45 year olds who are trying to get in the space and I understand their point of view when they say they don't want to work for free because they have something to lose. They have responsibilities. So it just makes sense um on that end. But I feel like this is still the first step just to get experience to get the momentum going. I actually dropped the email that I actually sent to my first uh to my first prospect, which was a a guy that I knew from an agency that I work with. Um I just told him, \"Hey, I just wanted to to help you out. Um can you help on a call?\" That was basically it. And this was 5 days after 6 days after I saw your videos, the first video on on automation. And I was like, \"Okay, this is this is so sick. Let me just do it. Let me just jump in. Keep moving.\" Um didn't know anything. Did literally zero idea what anything was. Just send a message because why not? And these are other messages as well. And the warp network is legit like the the thing that I really emphasize on this is just reaching out or maximizing your your contact list. So go through your contacts and just message each person that you know. And I was 19 by the way. I had when someone told me this to to reach out to my word network. I was like the first objection I had was I know I know no one like no friends are mine. I'm business owners. I have no friends who are business owners. Literally nothing. Um once you dig deep into it like you find that your sister's boss is a restaurant owner and your sister's friend's dad is another business owner. Uh and go from there. This is so so important to point out and I I have to I keep answering these same questions as well. It's like oh but I don't know anyone. I say you need to get your first clients for more marriage. If you just ask people around you and you make enough noise and let people know there are people in your network um who not either they themselves need it. So you have your first degree connections and then in this case it's like someone you know who knows someone. So here you've got like your uh your sister's uh your sister's connection, right? Um so that's a second degree connection. So instead of saying, \"Oh, I only know young people or students um and none of my family have a business.\" It's like, \"No, who do they know?\" Ask them, \"Hey, hey, mom, dad, hey, or like my auntie or your uncle or whatever it is.\" Is there anyone that you know would be interested? I do this stuff now. And so I think it's so helpful for people to see these screenshots right here. Um if you've ever wondered how to do it or how to actually reach out to people like that, something I wanted to start, I was like, what do people even say when they reach out to the world network? This is exactly the text message. I mean, it's nothing crazy. Like none of this is crazy. It's just reaching out to people that you know. Usually the way I would frame it um if you're 19 with no network and you have nobody to know, you just frame it as like do you have do you know do you happen to know anybody who'd be interested to just help or like help with and if they are interested themselves they'll say yeah I'd like that but if not then then you get access to their second degree connections as well. So it's this is the whole Aussie war outreach strategy. It's not like I've invented it. Uh it it works so just do it. And that's at the start that's what you have to do at the start. I mean, I think that's a non-negotiable unless you just just get so much traction that you need need to get free clients. But I think like this is a really Yeah, any other route the the school community one you're about to break down is is a really good one as well. But if the fastest way to get your first one, two, three clients is going to be through that warm warm network you've got. It's just faster. Like you can do it tomorrow. You know what I mean? If you know someone, you can just do it tomorrow. Max out your contact list, go through each one and just you will get something like I can guarantee you just each one. Yeah. I've actually got a full guide on the warm outreach, guys. I I'll link that down below. Um you guys can just grab that breaks down the whole strategy that uh that Mel's using there. The next strategy for me was school community. Uh so I actually joined your your free school community. I mean now it's insane actually the amount of people that are there. Um but this for me it was like where do I go where people are asking for for work and because you were like the the guy that was just doing all these things and had a free community and a lot of people just joined. So, in your job board hiring, there were a lot of people who were asking for jobs, asking for work, like, \"Hey, do you know someone who's able to to do XYZ?\" And this is the the job post that I saw from a guy who's actually my friend now. Uh he was my first um my second client in this case, and he was looking for a chatbot guy, boys. Uh and I just DM'd him and said, \"Hey, I'm from the UK. I build chat bots. Uh can we help on a call?\" And that was pretty much that second client. And just like that, again, another thing I've been yelling at people to do is like if you there's we have like 500 to sometimes a thousand people per day coming into that community. They're either posting in the introductions and saying, \"Hey, like I'm XYZ. Um I do this and you could just reach out and make a connection or the hiring channel where there's people looking for either looking for developers or they're they have a specific project in mind.\" So, if you actually go in there and and at the same time, if you grind a bit of sort of clout within the community and you start to post and like create a bit of share a bit of value, um being the go-to people or notable in that community is there's there's so much business you can get off the back of that. So, it's great to see this being being like actioned on and seeing results from it because I know that hiring board has got so much source in it. I think it's so underrated. I mean, especially because there's 200 plus K people in the in the community and some posts don't even get any comments or one to two comments. like there's so much opportunity out there um that you can just take action on. So these two were the the different strategies that I used to get my first clients clients in this case the first two uh for free war reach and then school community and do you want to just give us a an insight to you maybe be a bit vulnerable what was it really like doing those first few clients bro like did you feel out of depth or did you feel that you'd prepared well enough with the with the material you've been through on learning automations like what was going through your head at that at that point it was horrible I didn't know anything I just hopped on a call uh I just told them that I do chat bots and I was like I can make your chatbot better And then we went on the call, we went off the call and I was meant to use make.com as well for like the chatbot. And I had zero idea how to do it. And I had basically had to spend three four days going on authorizations with the client and he got pissed off and he ghosted me. Um, so like that was the that was the first. So that's that's setting up the setting up the accounts on make. Yeah. On Hopspot, on voice flow, on web hooks. I didn't know what a web hook was at that time. Uh, just zero. He just goes to me time. So yeah. I mean, for for the beginners, what's the best way that you've uh there's there's a bunch of different ways of approaching it, but for those initial setups, like do you have Loom videos now? Do you have a a like SOP that you pass over to the client for setting them up on certain platforms or giving you access? Like what's the way that you've refined that? I think for me, uh the the way that you I like to hop on calls like I've tried different things. I've tried sending Loom videos on because I already had tutorials and hey, here's how you can make your Make.com account. Here's how to connect your your Google Sheets to make.com. But I found that even with showing a step-by-step video, the client still has questions. So you you might as well just go on a call with them and just walk them through. Hey, share your screen. Click here, click there, connect this, connect that, and then it's just better. Even if you invest that one hour, it would be there anyways. All right, cool. Now we can get to getting more clients. So now we got free clients. We got the first the second client. How can get more people to know about our stuff? Um, in my opinion, when I first got started, the thing for me was content. That's the thing that I saw you do and that really inspired me to just just post content as soon as possible because content is actually one to many which means that you can make one content or one piece of content it can go to a million of people. So you can get a lot of stuff uh from there. Now when you get when I got introduced to content I got introduced to medium, YouTube, LinkedIn X and and Instagram and one thing that I find a lot of times that people try to stretch themselves out and just do everything and that's something that I did at the start as well. Uh because I did YouTube, I did LinkedIn, I did I think Medium. I had no I literally I was doing everything. Um and thankfully I had people like Casey who told me, \"Hey man, stop messing about just just focus on one platform and just do it do it really well.\" Yeah, this is like a chronic beginner issue and I I always try to hammer at home, but just like one is enough. Uh even for me like I'm I barely post on LinkedIn. We're starting to post a bit more um to talk about what we're doing at Morningside. Uh X we've just started posting on consistently. Instagram I basically never post and medium I've never done. Like if you just do one platform and do it really well. Um particularly the big ones like if you're just doing YouTube really well or just doing uh LinkedIn. I've seen guys doing short form content on Instagram and getting tons of leads for their agency and their school communities through through short form on Instagram. Um and I'm sure you could do the same on on Twitter. Like I don't really think there's anyone really running the running the X uh the X space when it comes to a automation agencies and things like that. So if you just pick one and do it well. uh with even guys in the accelerator doing the medium strategy and just posting on medium and getting tons of leads for your agency like that. So, but you just got to pick one and do it well because there's that skill curve of like actually getting deep in the platform and realizing, okay, what are the trending formats? Okay, I've done enough of these posts now that oh, this one popped off and you just start following these little grains of truth from the data that you get back on your post. Um, which I'm sure is what you're going to you're going to break down now. So, for me, okay, so I got introduced all these platforms. My decision on why I chose LinkedIn was based on where do the people that I want to target where do they hang out and what was I most comfortable using at the time and so the LinkedIn content that I had the strategy behind it is something is the reason why I booked over 300 400 calls uh just off of organic content and it was uh separated into three different types of posts. The first one is the automation videos which is to show your expertise. The second one is lead magnets to provide good stuff for free. And then the third one is personal uh show that you're just human that you have a story that you're not that you just have feelings and stuff. So that that's the main uh thing about content and that part of side. Now the automation videos itself what they are and what I did then is just got as many nodes on the screen as you could that's the hook. The crazier the crazier it looks. It's like the NA10 ones now is like the crazier the the the scenario or the workflow looks. But yeah, I mean it stops the scroll, doesn't it? Exactly. It just hooks them. Um, so YouTube was where I learned. So I learned YouTube and then I actually posted on LinkedIn. This is this was crazy to me. I was I was watching YouTube videos building automation. I was making them with them. So I was actually learning through the process and I was posting it on LinkedIn and then I got clients. That for me was like just a crazy process that I had to go through because it just people over complicate this so much. You just learn, post what you learn and then just do it over and over and over again. That's what I call like the the potential framework. I think you would have seen in the accelerator as well, but there's this very very powerful upward spiral that I I got stuck in and and you've got stuck in and anyone else who's who's really succeeding in the space get stuck in, which is you realize there's when you start doing content off the back of your skills acquisition. Like when you learn a certain thing, you are like you're not just learning in isolation. You are learning for the sake of content and then that can help you to get leads and then those leads convert into clients and then those clients give you learnings and then you can talk about that in your content again. So, it's this like powerful upward spiral where like some people will just learn in isolation and learn learn learn and then they'll try to like go and market whatever they've learned. But if you're learning and creating content at the same time, um, and just really really exploring your own curiosities and like how how far can I push this tech, that was like the biggest secret for me was just finding something that I was totally nerding out about and I just wanted like it felt like play to me cuz I was just cooking up this awesome stuff and then I made a video about it and like that that I'm sure you can agree is when you get into that like real playful zone is when you make your best content and it's when you're making content that's really pushing the the the boundaries of the space and that's what's actually unique. The lesson with content that I if if you just do this like you'll just succeed is post content as you get good not when you get good. That's like the main thing that you just mentioned here is like like no one like just document what you're doing because there's no real experts in the industry. I actually feel like there's no real experts. This only came out like two years ago. Um so that's why uh I think that's that's important. So automation videos is just to show your expertise. This is you building an automation and showing hey guys this is the automation I built. This is what it does. And fundamentally like when I started I was working with zero clients. So I wasn't showing any automations that I built for clients. I was just showing automations that I just built for fun, you know. And that's what I I think one of the the roadblocks that I got started with. I was like, \"Okay, but I post videos. How like I have no clients. How can I post videos about automations I never built clients?\" Personal projects. I I keep shouting from the roof about that as well. Like if you're looking to get started, find some personal projects. Like talk to the GBT and get it to like help you pull some ideas out. But there's some personal projects either if you're doing voice agents, if you're doing workflow automation, if you're doing like textbased agents, there are some personal projects that you can do. Yeah. And because of the fact that we're targeting business owners, the the thing to understand is like business owners don't have the time to set it up, but they have the time to be on their phones, look at what's possible in the space to then reach out to you uh for help. And that's like the the thing. Now, the second part is lead magnets. Now, if I were to uh point the success that I had on LinkedIn, it probably was on the lead magnets that I made. So lead magnets fundamentally comes from the fact that you're playing within LinkedIn's algorithm. So the way it works is that you make a post, let's say Ulium, you comment on my post, your whole network, everyone who follows you sees that you in my post. It's like a compounding effect that just follows. And as you can see, I mean, it did pretty well. Um, damn. That's so important to to point out how how the algorithm actually works on on LinkedIn. It's just like with YouTube, you understand that they they're incentivized to recommend videos that are going to lead to long watch times and long sessions. just and on LinkedIn anytime someone comments if you can try to bait someone into commenting like if you maybe made a post about me and then I happened to comment on it then boom it goes to my whole network right and so the the lead magnets like this and asking them for them to to comment is going to get all of that spread out into other people's networks right like the thing about LinkedIn that I found over time is that it doesn't so much matter about the algorithm itself it's more so that you just share value like the way that you share value is different right here is through a video showing hey guys I just built this here's what it does I've never worked with the business but here's what it does and here's just me giving away some stuff. Um, and that's playing the LinkedIn algorithm. And I'll break down the exact post and how they work, all that sort of stuff. So, we can go that into more detail. The third one is personal show that you're human. Again, this right here, I think, is so underrated. You saw Mer, he did some personal post that did really well. H is the fact that LinkedIn necessarily like two years ago, two three years ago, it was just seen as a hiring platform. I still I think I still think it is seen as a hiring platform. And with the fact that LinkedIn is seen as a as a very serious platform and everyone's so serious and so like I'm proud to announce um then people necessarily care about their personal stories and that's like the proud to announce and that's like the the main thing is like if everyone's so professional don't be professional be yourself just share about your story of course like to the limit but um personal always builds up this is what builds a brand like this this right here I think what helps build a brand of like you're not just working with zooming on to that that bottom Lux over performance start learning. Sick. That's like showing behind the scenes the grind. That's like so so powerful, man. And what I really love about that this whole strategy if you zoom out a bit is like these are different content formats uh to zoom out to all three of them. And this is something that you guys really need to regardless of what kind of content you're doing is finding these different formats. And if you look at this, it's freaking genius because you have the lead magnets which are helping you to get pushed out into the algorithm. That's the discovery. It's like on YouTube here, I'll make some videos that are intended to go broad and get me discovered by new people. Those lead magnets are going to get you shown to a lot of new people. Then when they come in, they might like like or follow or connect with you in some way. And then they'll see on your page, you've got all of these show your expertise videos. And while those might not go as crazy, they will see that, oh, this guy's actually had a consistent track record of posting things that he knows. So, not only did he put this out, but one, he's a real person and he's got these like this is someone I might want to work with because he's obviously um into some interesting things or he's working really hard and he's got the expertise. This is like I'd say why this has worked for you so well is because you've got that discovery mechanism and then the credibility and authority and then also that human element to it. So, if you guys are doing content across any platform, the same thing applies. is need to find out how you're going to get pushed into the algorithm, how you're going to get discovered and then how you're going to show your expertise and then some element of of being a real person that people can actually relate to. So, I think you've freaking cracked it, mate. That's a it's textbook. But I mean the like we mentioned focusing on W platform. This is exactly why before I before I could put this together to show you guys it took me a year like a solid year which isn't a long time but like hours and hours and hours and hours just in my room just understanding what it is, how to do it, how to just get better and better and better. Invested money into like LinkedIn coaching and all that. Like all this stuff that I did to get really good at one platform and I'm still not good enough. To tell you enough like just being one platform is just so so key because like this is hard. Um imagine trying to do that across three at once. It's just there's just no way. Yeah. And that's why most people just stick to one platform and then they expand to different platforms when they understand one platform good enough. Um okay. So the automation videos lead magnets personal. The let's go on a deeper level. Let's look at the actual breakdown of the post itself. Each post on LinkedIn is similar. It has a hook. It has a body and CTA. Now CTA optional depending on the type of post that you make, but something that I always like to have because it drives them to take action. So the hook right here, one of the most important things about the post because fundamentally when you go on LinkedIn, most people don't know this, but 70% of the audience or people who are using LinkedIn are at work on their phones, right? So you want to make sure that the hook itself has 40 characters online, which is mobile optimized, summarizes the whole post. So when I look at this, I basically already want to understand exactly what the post is about without having to read it. And best to add numbers. So when you add numbers, it just shows results, more credibility, something that we're more willing to to do. uh especially for business owners because they have no time. They want to see exactly how it impacts them and how like the outcome the outcome that they can have for their own business by looking at this post. Then we have the body of the email. So this right here is just in this case a list uh works great. So step one is this, step two is this, three and four. And again, this is for automation videos. So hey, I build this automation. Here's what it does, right? In this case is what it does part. Um avoid paragraphs, make it easy for the reader. Again, I mean, you've probably seen posts on LinkedIn that are just like three paragraphs long. Nobody reads that. So, don't even like don't even try it for that. Um, and the and like you've got those little arrows put in there as well to like literally guide the eyes onto the next onto the next line. It's not just a bullet point. It's like actually an arrow pointing them to it. Um, so like guiding their eyes through each line. Now, the CTA, which is essentially what do we want the the person to do? A lot of people don't add this, which you're missing out on because a lot of people because of the LinkedIn algorithm, because like commenting is like a big part of LinkedIn and you want someone to drive action, to take action, do something. In this case, one just tell them, here's the next step you want to take. In this case, because I'm repurposing a YouTube content, you can say, hey, check out the link in the comments for the walkthrough. So, fundamentally, that's a strategy that I had for LinkedIn. Um, and I mean, right here, I broke down exactly how we can write each post, the different types of post and and so on. We'll leave the link down below just in case you want to take a look at it. Yeah, there's tons of good stuff here, guys. So, if you are wanting to do LinkedIn and really break down the strategy, Kell has really fully broken down how he's writing these posts. So, uh, for the sake of the people who aren't maybe going to go all in on LinkedIn, uh, I'll link that down below with those other links there, you guys can check this out. Super valuable. I mean, if there's anything you want to copy or or take inspiration from, then then it's just so I really appreciate you sharing this with the guys. Yeah, no worries. And honestly, like the the formats of the post are very templated in a sense. So, it's if you follow once, if you see it once, you won't see it. Uh, you will not forget it and you just copy it. So, uh, that's pretty much it for the content strategy. And then down below, I mean, that is the reason why I was booking two to six calls a day from LinkedIn organic with no nothing paid, which is pretty unheard of um to say from one LinkedIn account from one guy just in his bedroom just trying to make it. Um I think that two to six calls a day was was pretty good. And and that was all What was your what was your like conversion mechanism off that? Cuz obviously a lot of engagement. I hear a lot of people saying, \"Oh, I might have got a bit of traction or impressions, but I wasn't able to convert those into book calls or qualified calls.\" So were you like you're shooting them the link to the resource in the DMs and then you're starting a conversation from there or how much are you automating this as well? So the funny thing is I didn't send a single DM for months like a single DM. Um what I was doing is just putting the lead magnet and then updating the post later with the link um and then letting them know. Now, fundamentally, like yes, I was sending them the resource, but I wasn't pushing for a call because previously what I know what I did before was like I put the the lead magnet, for example, like the 3,000 comments. I was just on my phone replying to each one. I'll send it to you. I'll send it I'll send in the lead magnet. I never follow up because I didn't need to because I was getting already two to six calls a day just from like just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's a supply issue, not a demand issue. It was a the same thing. Same thing. I think anyone who gets their acquisition and particularly content working well under this like for us at Morningside, it's not never been a never been a demand issue. It's always been a supply like how many new clients can we actually take on cuz there's just so much especially when you're doing general dev. I mean I guess it's like a good problem to have but it's still like it was still pretty bad. Um cuz the conversion off of like the book calls is horrible. I mean we can get into it still process that I had was consultation 45 minutes then proposal call another 45 minutes and then I had a 5% close rate. Now that's not even noticeable. I mean that's horrible. Um but the the the close rate was honestly it's just a numbers game. I'm like out of a hundred people that I speak to, I think one of them is gonna say yes, you know, and and and in between the consultation and the proposal is like four hours of like prepping and proposal writing and prep like putting together the slide deck and getting ready to prop like present it to them, right? So, I remember we would spend like four to six hours like prepping. As the projects get bigger and bigger as well, there's like way more you need to cover and more more like working with the devs to figure out how long it's going to take. But yeah, give us the how do you get over this one, bro? I I love this part. On that note, man, I was using Canva like every day for like three, four hours just putting like like you said proposals together. This looks pretty. This looks nice. Um but over time you realize like you can cut it down. Um and you get on the call and and they just not you realize you haven't financially qualified them at all and then they like they see the price and they go oh like they get a shock and then you just never hear from them again. So Exactly. Yeah. So the problem here wasn't the amount of book calls that I got. It's just conversion. Like I I had no friction which means that I had I think two three questions on the on the actual form. they could book in at any time they wanted for how long they wanted. Uh, and they just just came right in, right? And I just had to book calls every single day. I was so stressed. I was it was just horrible. The process that I went through to actually solve this was through actually changing my my sales process. So, fundamentally, it's just adding more friction, which means that you now tell the client, we only have a 20-minute consultation, which is free, so they can book in. Um, and this is more than enough time, more than enough time to like figure out exactly like sort of like where they're at and so on. And then if they're qualified, not qualified, but if they're Yeah. qualified, I'll say, then you pitch an audit. Now, this is something that I got off of your video where you mentioned an exploratory um expiration milestone. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, that's that's the thing that I implemented. So, I told them, hey, if you want to work with me, you have to pay $200 for one hour for the audit. So, that actually made it worth my time to even hop on a call with a business owner. And that did three things. That increased my my ability to close because I spend more time with the business owner. that can actually like teach them some stuff and in in a sense and actually take them through different things see more opportunities for upsells later on because when you break down everything and audit you start to see more problems more problems so you can start start making like a road map as to like we can do this first and then that um and then the third thing is just you get more qualified people because if they're willing to pay for it they're they're going to be willing to pay for for whatever it is that you have now this is key guys I've I'll put the video that uh that is referencing here on on how we do exploration milestones at Morning Side. We'll link that down below as well. But it's really important. We had the same issues at Morningside. Terrible close rate despite tons and tons of leads. And as soon as you put a financial qualification in, either like it's a quick audit call or it's like we would hop off the end of our consults at Morningside and we'd say, \"Okay, yeah, we're ready to go on this.\" Basically, like there's a few there's always a few unknowns here. So, we're going to start at like 800 or or 1500 or now it's like $5 $10,000 for us what we charge for these initial engagements. But, we're going to explore these different solutions and we're going to see if it's actually technically feasible for you. And then at at the end of that, you get the full proposal and then we can move into the next next part of the the contract. What was it for you though? Um how did you know when to price the audit the the milestone that you that you did with them? When to or how to price it? How did you know how much how much to price them? Cuz you mentioned it's like three 10K. Like how did you Yeah, it's it's based off the size of the client and also the size of the project. So if it's like a huge one and we're talking about it's going to be like a 100 $200,000 project. We've just done a a uh expiration phase. We're in the middle of one just wrapping up at the moment. That's I think it was $10,000 or at least five figures um for the exploration part alone. And that started as as like a $500 like it, let's see if they say yes and then it went up to $800 then,000 and like we just gradually increased it um as the size of our clients grew as well. So you can just start super low like you do with this this audit just anything to financially qualify them to get the tire kickers out. Now they improve I say improved because I my closure went to 40%. Which is much better like an 8x from the 5% that I had. I was so much less stressed. I was making more because the quality of clients was increasing and I was working with less clients, less calls and more time uh to do whatever I want. Um, all right. So, that right there fundamentally is how the LinkedIn strategy was and that's what I used to get more people to know about my stuff. The next milestone or phrase that I had to go through was productizing my offer. Now, the reason why I wanted to productize my offer, it was by choice because with make.com for automations, because of the reason why it's custom, you get a lot of problems that I had to go through. The first one is scope creep. So, every single client that you that you get into doing a project, what it looks like at the start and what it actually looks like at the end, it's completely different. Completely different. So, uh it was it was it wasn't that nice when you had to figure when you figured out that something couldn't be done the way that you thought it was or when the client told you, hey, we actually have this step and you're like, oh, that changes everything. And then you got to like be a bit of an ass. You feel like you've been an  about it. You're like, no, but like that's that's not what we agreed on, man. Like, we're going to I'm going to need to charge you more for that. Um, and that's some uncomfortable discussions that I think early agency owners maybe aren't super great at dealing with, but just like knowing your value and saying, \"No, this is this is what we agreed on.\" Um, so yeah, I mean it's just about understanding that you're helping them like they're not help like they're not helping you at the sense, you know? So like position yourself is like I mean I'm making you a favor. So like let's let's just work together to make sure that we can we can get this going uh and whatever extra work we need. The the only thing for me at the start was like I told them let's say we're doing an onboarding system. The outcome is we'll do a fully onboarding a fully automated onboarding system but that that's the outcome you sign on the contract but the onboarding system changed over time but the outcome was still I had to do the onboarding system so I still have to do the project yes or yes and that wasn't that was a non-negotiable for us uh and you can talk to the client and so on but um at the start it was it wasn't something that I that I had the the balls to just go to the client and just say all right so when it came to productizing my offer um apart from scope creep we also had the knowledge gap so knowledge gap just means that whenever a new client came through they're from a different niche I had to relearn the whole market to un to contextualize the automation to like their business. And so that came from from just not knowing any niche and just figuring out as I go. But productizing my offer, the first part of it was just niching down. And so what I did is I analyzed the past 10 months of clients and I asked myself who did I like to work with, what brought the most money and what recurring problem that I get asked to solve the most. And that's like the that's the fundamental thing of like, okay, I need to niche down. And I analyzed all my calls, all the clients that I worked with, all that sort of stuff to then niche down to uh to the offer that I'm that I'm running now, which is again working with agencies um in specific for the client delivery, which is very niche. That's so far, man. I I think if you've like nailed it with that, that's such like a for the people that you're trying to help, that's like exactly what they they want to hear. Double client capacity without hiring more people in 30 days. It's so specific. Uh that's that's just such a fire positioning statement. So niche. So niche. this is like this super niche that um I mean there's there's not a lot of people who do this but fundamentally it's like when you niche down you're just scared that you're just missing out on opportunities but for me it's like I couldn't I couldn't do the custom work anymore so I had to do more so something that was repeatable so you can do every single time but also I knew the niche really well um and I could solve the actual problem that they had and by the way if you guys want to take a look at the the LinkedIn profile that I had when I actually had the offer this is what it looked like outcome picture statement and then the about section as well awesome yeah I mean that's typical way I laid it out. And so for me, the important thing was prioritizing my offer to make things repeatable. Um, so the delivery itself had to be repeatable because it was solving one painoint for one niche. And so the delivery process that we had was using a framework that I made over time which is called the AIAT framework. It all started with the audit. So fundamentally what this is is a call with me and the founder just breaking down the process that they went through from the moment a client signs to the moment a client to deliver the service and the whole process they had to go through that. Now this process was crucial again because without this we can't go to the next step. Um so fundamentally we just break down their whole thing is it's about one to two hour calls that we do with the with the clients and uh yeah this is an example that we had. Then we have the implementation phase and this is where we centralize their project management system on notion and these are the dashboards that um where they basically manage their whole client delivery. So team tasks um projects all that sort of stuff there. Okay. And so this is you migrating them over to something that you've built right. So this is a template that you've created and you're like this is my system. this is how you're going to be able to scale your uh like increased number of clients you can you can handle without hiring more people. So you're sort of pushing them onto this because I know the niche really well and I know that agencies to manage their client delivery they use one software and other software and three other softwares and everything's so scattered. So notion is a software we use because it allows us to put everything in one place. So yeah that's references everything here. So implement project management and then we go to the automation part which is where we automated at least 30% of the whole client delivery using make.com. So see how I'm not discarding make.com. I'm just putting it into like a higher ticket more um just more transformation for the agency. That's increasing and integrating with like a bigger system in this case. Mhm. And so you you're just changing these around maybe like 20% of the work done that you would have had to do initially is just like tweaking it around, changing the prompts, making sure it's all working as as expected. 100%. I mean cuz I knew the niche really well and they all had similar problems. They they all had a similar process. Um, so it wasn't it wasn't like a crazy amount of difference from each each sort of agency. And the next part is train. So we obviously had a delivery call with the team. We made SOPs uh that we can put them in notion. So we they know exactly how the the whole system works. And then we have the optimized period which is 60 days. So we improve the system over time. We jump up bi-weekly calls with the whole team and make sure that any changes are made after using the system. Now, this is great for us because we get to cultivate the relationship with the client, which is, I believe, is one of the most important things as you're getting into higher ticket because this right here, this offer was going for 9.5K. Um Mhm. And so, 9.5K. Yeah. Damn, bro. That's bro, that's way more than I than I would have expected. That's freaking awesome. Just positioning, bro. Uh positioning, bro. And and it's also like if you got enough leads, you can afford to be, you know, like the more demand you have uh on these calls, like if you have only 10 people coming to you, you might have to sell it for five because like the chance of you having people who are are willing to pay that much is is is a lot less. But you have 100 people, there's going to be a handful of those who do have the budgets and are willing to spend more on this AI stuff than than the others. You can kind of volume your way into high ticket. Um which is basically what we've done at Morningside as well. I mean just just to let you know like the I ran an offer campaign on LinkedIn to get these clients. I sent about 580 loons personalized loons to people and to get my to get one one client which is 10k but like the in the upside is like so much better because it's 10k instead of just 2k which is like a normal project. Um so you ideally you want to work with less clients who pay more and increase ever made. So that's that. All right, let me go to the last milestone or the last process that I had to go through, which is how to outsource. So, how to make sure that now you have all these clients, you have these projects. How can you give it to someone else so you can focus on actually growing the business, making content because it is a full-time job like James said. So, the strategy for me was using three different places. The first one was the uh AAA um school community. So, I just put a post here, which is a full circle moment cuz I used to look for jobs here and now I'm putting a job there for someone to to talk out to me. That's the ecosystem, man. Like, it it works. And I'm on my YouTube videos telling business owners like go into my school community and post for you like make posts saying you're looking for certain things. Like you can come in here to to make posts about hiring as well. And then other people can come in here looking for work. Like it's a perfect perfect meeting of the two sides of this space right now. 100%. And uh the second thing for me was making a post on LinkedIn asking if anyone's interested now because right because I was doing notion as well like it was more it wasn't something that I could ideally find here. I mean, I posted here. I didn't get anything great off of Notion, but workflow automations because it's the AI automation space, I got like tons of people. So, that was that was good for me. So, LinkedIn as well. And then the accelerator, I mean, you guys have a whole literally a whole like place to to find people and they're they're vetted. Like, you won't put them there if they're not good. So, I used as well. All right. And when outsourcing to other people, the problems that you're going to find when you're when you're giving work to someone else, at least that I find um is you don't have enough cash flow to hire someone full-time. So, you hire a freelancer. The problem is is that freelancers are cheap but and they're lower quality, right? So that means you have to spend more time on training and resources. And what I found at least the freelancers that I worked for, they weren't not delivering on the timelines that I set. But it's like the the balance is like you will only pay more for someone who's more skilled but you don't have the cash flow um compared to someone who is cheaper, but you have to put more time into like making sure that you do the right job. Yeah, I've been I've been ringing this bell for for a long time. We had those that was our first when I was getting Morning Side AI off the ground. It was it was Upwork freelancers initially and they just you're one of you're one of 10 clients and I mean they're probably not even like they might just be good at reaching out out to people within the community and they've got a lot of projects but they're not super skilled. Um and so you want to be able to get to that point where you can pay someone to get all of their time and that's such a big unlock for any any agency or anything you're doing here in the AI space is that first full-time developer because they can drive so much uh in results and deliveries for you. So um it is it is a tricky period initially with these with the freelancers. I mean the good thing about my offer was that it wasn't so custom so like I could train someone to do it. Um and the the thing that really ended up happening was that I just got a notion guy who just did not stuff cuz that was like the main thing structuring the system and I offloaded the the make.com to someone else as well. So I had these two people in the same time. Now the solutions that I can that you can implement that I implemented was set expectations on day one make them want to work with you. I think that's one of the the main things is like I mean people if you have someone who's good who's I mean if you have someone who you can see potential that they're actually good make them want to work with you like invest time into making sure that they're all set uh to make sure that you stay and you basically form a long-term relationship because working with someone I mean you your business is your baby like you want to make sure that it actually grows and you want to make sure that the people who are taking care of the business are are just they're solid and they have a they see your vision. Yeah. Super in invested in what you're doing. Yeah. And that's uh that's part of that when the leadership skills come into play is like painting the vision. I mean like look we're going places like this is do you want to be on the ship like look I want to get you into these roles like you can really step up into this position. Um and the right people will respond really well to that. And uh that's that's how I've always approached leading these people. And right here I mean we walk through the whole five-step process that uh that I went through to get to 100K with the with the agency. And fundamentally along the way you just get to learn new skills for here is just automations. Then here is how to reach out to people for the first time. Then here is content, which is a massive one. Here's offers, um, leads, all that sort of stuff you want to know. And then here's how to outsource, which is fundamentally all the skills you need to learn, um, you're going to have to learn to to get point. Yeah. I mean, it's it's the the the business 101 skill set, right? Like how to get clients, how to, uh, run the operations of the business, how to hire people and manage them, um, how to learn skills that you're going to eventually be able to monetize as well. So, mate, that's been uh some mega mega source. If you guys can't uh haven't got anything out of that, then there's something wrong with you. As someone who's on calls regularly with people, I'm talking to hundreds and hundreds of people across the community. I see it firsthand in my communities as well. What people are struggling with and what's making them ultimately succeed. It's all of these roadblocks that Mckelly's broken down here. And he's basically given a textbook way of getting over each of these. So, it's awesome to see you just flawlessly execute on the exact strategy that we've uh we've laid out for you, man. And uh I'm so excited for what what's to come for you, mate, cuz you're you're absolutely crushing it. I appreciate you, man. And I mean this is a repeatable process that anyone can go through. I'm not not doing any magic here. This is what works. Just do it, focus, and just be consistent. So, really, really appreciate you and and all the best. I hope you guys can agree that that was absolutely packed with source for you beginners looking to get into building an AI business. Like I said, if you guys want to get in touch with Mikuel and his agency, the links will be down there. And if you guys want to be featured on this podcast as guest, you have a story to tell, or you have some secret source that you really think could benefit the community, then you can apply to be on here on my channel using one of the links in the description below. If you want to hear another incredible success story about two 19year-olds from Turkey making $320,000 with the AI agency by selling AI audits, that's broken down here in this full interview that I did with them. But that's all for the video, guys. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next",

          "transcript": "Nesse vídeo aqui, eu vou te falar o por que você não deveria focar em aprender automações, ou melhor, em aprender automações, não, em ser um automatizador em 2026. Talvez eu te fale algumas verdades duras, mas é importante que você ouça isso com atenção, entenda e tome suas próprias decisões com relação aos fatos que eu vou trazer aqui para você. Ah, vamos lá. Primeira coisa que eu já quero pontuar, eu tenho total propriedade para falar isso que eu vou falar para vocês. Eu sou da área de tecnologia desde que eu me conheço por gente. Comecei a desenvolver aos meus 16 anos, montei uma empresa de tecnologia, uma das principais insurtechs do Brasil. Eu vendi essa empresa, eu tive uma carreira também como desenvolvedor, programador, fui evoluindo, virei arquiteto de software. Eh, eu adoro programar. Até hoje eu só deixei de programar porque eu decidi focar realmente naquilo que dá dinheiro, que é negócio, tá? Então eu tenho bastante propriedade para falar isso para vocês. Hoje eu tenho uma empresa de tecnologia que é a Acelera 360, que é uma escola onde eu ajudo pessoas a empreender com inteligência artificial, com tecnologia. Então assim, eu tenho muita propriedade para falar nisso. Eu vou trazer alguns fatos relevantes aqui para você, para que você entenda o meu ponto de vista. Primeiro ponto, a evolução da inteligência artificial. A I tá evoluindo numa velocidade tão grande, mas tão grande, que eu diria que nos próximos 6 meses essas grandes empresas que inclusive desenvolveram ferramentas de automação, vão desenvolver um modelo onde é possível criar qualquer tipo de automação através de linguagem natural, como se você através do prompt. Então, pessoas que se especializarem em escrever bons prompts vão conseguir criar qualquer tipo de automação. Recadinho rápido para você que tá assistindo meu vídeo. No dia 4/10 eu vou te mostrar no meu workshop que vai acontecer online como você pode empreender com inteligência artificial. Então, mesmo que você não seja técnico, mesmo que você não entenda nada de programação, mesmo que você não saiba nem mexer no N8N, no make, em agente, não importa. Eu quero que você esteja lá comigo no dia 4/10, porque eu vou te mostrar uma infraestrutura de crescimento com inteligência artificial. Você vai clicar no link que tá aqui na descrição desse vídeo e vai garantir a sua vaga, porque são 200 vagas e eu já vendi mais de 170. Então não perca, tá terminando já, hein? Te vejo lá. Entendam uma coisa, a barreira da tecnologia, a barreira tecnológica de programar, de codificar, de desenvolver, ela está diminuindo a cada dia que passa. Do mesmo jeito que os programadores estão sendo ameaçados, os automatizadores que atuam ali mais num meio que num low code, baixo código para você que não conhece, estarão cada vez ainda mais ameaçados que o próprio programador. Então se pro programador vai ficar difícil, imagina para você que mexe no N8N, no Make, no organizando bloquinhos no CTRA e por aí vai. Então, só isso já deixa para você um grande sinal de alerta, tá, Kelvin? Quer dizer que eu não preciso aprender sobre automação? Não, não foi isso que eu disse. Eu disse que você não deve focar 100% em ser um automatizador, em ser um construtor de fluxo. O mercado tá ficando saturado. Existe uma baixa barreira de entrada para pessoas que querem se tornar automatizadores, pessoas que querem construir automações. Então, por esse motivo, cara, tá virando um Mar Vermelho. E quem tá falando isso para você é um cara que consegue vender, por exemplo, uma automação a R$ 40, R$ 50.000, entendeu? Tá, Kelvin, mas se você consegue vender tudo isso, por que que eu não deveria focar em automação? Porque o B2B, o empresário que me paga R$ 40, R$ 50.000 por uma automação, ele não está comprando automação. A automação ela é o meio, mas o que eu vendo é o fim. Então, por isso eu quero que você entenda que você deve desenvolver outras habilidades, focar em desenvolver outras habilidades que sim vão fazer você ter mais sucesso em 2026 do que você ser um excepcional, um exímio automatizador. Assim como hoje não faz mais sentido você ser um programador muito um especialista em tudo, não faz sentido você ser um automatizador muito Você pode desenvolver outras habilidades que vai fazer você ganhar muito mais dinheiro do que necessariamente a automação. E é sobre isso que nós vamos falar aqui nesse vídeo. No final das contas, a gente vai falar sobre como você vai fazer mais dinheiro, tá? Passando aqui de novo para perguntar se você já comprou, já garantiu essa vaga do meu workshop. Não. Clica aqui, ó. Tá no link na descrição desse vídeo. Bora, vamos empreender com primeiro passo. É muito fácil as pessoas saberem criar fluxos de automação, mas saber o que automatizar e o que priorizar primeiro para ser automatizado, isso é difícil. E para que você saiba o que é automatizar e o que que pode ser automatizado, o ideal é você entender mais de negócio, entender como uma empresa funciona, empreender, por exemplo, de não não de forma profunda, mas de forma detalhada sobre como funciona um processo de vendas, como funciona, por exemplo, um processo de entrega eh de nichos específicos, como funciona um processo de pós-vendas, um processo financeiro, como que funciona um processo de captação de lead, um processo de marketing. Se você tiver uma visão de dessas áreas, de um determinado nicho, você vai ser uma pessoa extremamente requisitada no mercado. Se você então entender do negócio e também entender da automação, da programação, da lógica, da lógica de programação, da lógica de desenvolvimento de software e da lógica de negócio, você se torna uma pessoa altamente requisitada. E isso sim vai fazer você ganhar muito dinheiro. Porque, por exemplo, o cara que vou vou dar um um pequeno exemplo aqui. Eu peguei um cliente, o cliente ele é um expert, esse cliente ele vende um produto digital e a gente fez um trabalho nele de recuperação de carrinho. Que que é recuperação de carrinho? Entrava para ele 1000 leads por mês. Dos 1000 leads, ele fazia 5% de vendas daqueles leads. 95% ele não vendia. Então o que que nós construímos? Sim, com automação, com chatbot, com um monte de coisinha, com ferramenta, com CRM, por aí vai. Nós construímos para ele uma máquina de recuperação de carrinhos. O que que é uma máquina de recuperação de carrinhos? É um CRM fazendo a gestão dos possíveis leads. É um fluxo de importação dos leads de um de algum determinado lugar para dentro dessa ferramenta, desse CRM. é um processo onde a gente começa a nutrir estes leads em um determinado momento do tempo com uma determinada narrativa, com uma determinada oferta e aí no final é o pit, a entrada em contato via ligação ou a oferta. É a oferta, chamar ele e falar: \"E aí quer comprar?\" E depois a conversão. Nessa brincadeira, nessa brincadeira de 1000 leads, a gente conseguiu trazer para ele mais 5% de conversão. Sabe o que significa isso? A gente dobrou o faturamento dele. E aí você pode pensar assim: \"Nossa, Kelvin, mas cara, como assim? Ele vendia só 5%.\" É, é assim que funciona. As pessoas elas ganham dinheiro, mas elas também deixam muito dinheiro na mesa. Elas perdem, elas elas não estão preocupadas em pegar esses dinheiros mais difíceis, né? Elas estão preocupadas em pegar os dinheiros mais fáceis, né? Todo mundo foca ali geralmente nas frutas baixas. Então, às vezes, até mesmo às vezes não, a maioria das da das empresas tem processos que são extremamente ineficientes. E esses processos eles se tornam cada vez mais ineficientes, até mesmo por conta das pessoas que estão lá e por conta do processo operacional que as próprias empresas implementam. Então, é muito difícil você encontrar uma empresa que para fazer uma revisão completa em seus processos. Então, a ineficiência é uma ineficiência que tá lá desde antes até daquele profissional ter entrado, ter sido contratado, tudo mais e ninguém trata, às vezes ninguém nem sabe o motivo. Então, por isso que eu digo em vários meus vídeos que é muito importante pr, no caso, as pessoas que querem empreender, entender muito bem o nicho de atuação, escolher um nicho de atuação, porque a partir do momento que você entende o nicho de atuação, você foca em o nicho, você começa a entender as dores que aquele nicho tem, que as empresas daquele nicho t e aí você meio que fala a língua daquelas empresas e você consegue captar mais clientes. Mas voltando ao ponto aqui das automações, cara, faz muito mais sentido vocês gastarem energia estudando, vai coloca ali 20% do tempo de vocês estudando a parte técnica e 80% estudando a parte de negócio do que vocês focarem em 100% da energia de vocês aprendendo a parte técnica. Tô passando aqui de novo para perguntar se você já garantiu a sua vaga do workshop grow que vai acontecer no dia 4/10. Não clica no link aqui na descrição desse vídeo, vai ser online, não perca. É mais barato que uma pizza, Estudando N8N, estudando make, estudando ser o melhor automatizador do mundo, ser o melhor construtor de agentes via N8N do mundo, construir os melhores chatbots e sabe, não faz sentido. Faz muito mais sentido você focar energia em 20% na parte técnica e 80% na parte de negócio, porque a parte de negócio é a parte que vai fazer você fechar bons contratos. A parte de negócio é realmente a parte que vai fazer você ganhar dinheiro, que você vai sair do zero. Então esse é meu conselho para vocês. É um vídeo rápido, é uma opinião minha que eu decidi trazer aqui para vocês para poder ajudar vocês, porque o ano de 2025 já acabou, né? Valeu, rapaziada. Tchau.",

          "transcript": "Yes, I'm in a hotel again. I'm in Meta Connect, but I needed to bring you the news. The first story is the Meta Ray-B band glasses, which I've had for a long time. The demo video, which was leaked earlier this week, shows what the future of Meta Rayban glasses are going to look like. So, you'll be able to talk to your AI. Your AI will be able to see the world. It'll be able to hear the world, and it will be able to project things onto a clear screen that only you can see. It truly is incredible technology. Meta is definitely going allin on the glasses form factor, which makes a lot of sense given their history with ARVR and the Oculus. And if you've watched this channel at all, if you follow me on X, of course, Matthew Berman, you know that I'm more bearish on the glasses form factor. But it turns out a third of the world wears glasses on a daily basis. Now, I can't imagine a world in which I'm wearing glasses all day, every day, but maybe I'll be proven wrong. We'll see. Okay, next. Open AAI's reasoning model just accomplished superhuman intelligence. It got a perfect 12 out of 12 score during the 2025 ICPC World Finals. Listen to this. The ICPC World Finals, the premier collegiate programming competition where top university teams from around the world solve complex algorithmic problems. This would have placed it first among all human participants. They had a 5-hour time limit in which they had to solve all 12 problems. These are the most difficult coding problems in the world. We received the problems in the exact same PDF format as humans. And the reasoning system selected which answers to submit with no bespoke test time harness whatsoever. For 11 of the 12 problems, the system's first answer was correct. For the hardest problem, it succeeded on the ninth submission. Notably, the best human team achieved 11 of 12. So they competed with an ensemble of generalpurpose reasoning models and did not train a specific model for this competition. They had both GBT5 and an experimental reasoning model generating solutions. So there's maybe a new model coming. We'll see. And if you think this is just OpenAI tooting their own horn, listen to this. This is Scott Woo, CEO of Cognition. So insane you guys have no idea how hard this is. And for those of you who don't remember, Scott Woo is basically a math genius. He was competing in crazy difficult math competitions at a very early age. So if anybody is to say how incredibly difficult this is, it's him. And just to wrap it all up, Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI. We wrapped up this year's competition circuit with a full score on the ICPC after achieving sixth in IOI, a gold medal at the IMO, and second in the AT coder heristic contest. The core intelligence of these models are incredible. They are more than enough. We just need to build the scaffolding now. And next we have our first paper by Meta Super Intelligence Labs. In this paper, they optimize rag retrieval augmented generation. That is the system that allows AI to store information and to retrieve information from natural language documents. So give it all of your PDFs, give it all of your internal documentation from your company and it can easily pull that context out of all that documentation, put it in the context window and then answer any questions you have. So in this paper they make Rag faster by swapping most retrieved tokens for premputed and reusable chunk embeddings called refrag. This method improves its speed by 30x and fitting 16x longer contexts without accuracy loss. This is just another feather in the cap of building incredible scaffolding for these models. And speaking of scaffolding, tool calling is an incredible part of that. And Zapier, the sponsor of today's video, has over 8,000 tools that you can call. Let me tell you about them. We use Zapier for so many automations at my company. Let me show you how we take a news story and convert it into a fully formatted social media post. The first thing we do is create a new record in Asauna with just the URL of the news story and then it automatically creates a record in air table again all through Zapier. Then we have two paths in Zapier, one for X and one for Instagram. We use chat GPT to create a short headline based on the content of the article. Firecrawl to grab additional assets and information and banner bear to create the header image for the story. And it will also put text on that image very easily. And then we take all of that and we push it to Buffer for publishing. All of this saves us a tremendous amount of manual effort and it's all powered by AI orchestration by Zapier. This is just one of dozens of the different workflows that we use with Zapier. So if you want to try this out or other automations, it's super easy. I'll drop a link down below to Zapier. Check it out. Let them know I sent you by clicking the link. And thanks again to Zapier. Now back to the video. Next, AI chip builder Grock, GRQ, has secured $750 million in new funding at a postfunding valuation of $6.9 billion. The funding round is led by Disruptive and includes Black Rockck and Newberger Burman, unrelated to me. The company will use the funds to expand its data center capacity, including new locations this year and next, according to Jonathan Ross, CEO, who've I've interviewed in the past on this channel. And Grock plans to announce its first Asia-Pacific location this year. It seems like the overwhelming thirst for inference for tokens is unquenchable. Nvidia is selling everything they have. Gro is selling everything they have. Cerebrus is selling everything they have. And so all of these companies are just spending as much money as they can building out this AI infrastructure. And I'm here for it. I'm so excited for all of this buildout to happen. All right. Next in the rumor mill, it seems Gemini 3.0 O might be right around the corner. A keen eye by Liam breaking Gemini 3.0 Ultra spotted in Google's Gemini CLI repo committed 4 days ago. And take a look at this. Here it is in the repo. Model Gemini 3.0 Ultra. So, we'll see when we're actually going to get the model. Maybe it's going to show up as an anonymous model on LM Arena or somewhere else. And you know, I'm going to be testing it out. So definitely if you're not already subscribed, subscribe so you can see that when I drop it. He follows up with more on the Gemini 3.0 Ultra leak found in Google Gemini Gemini CLI main branch. Remember Gemini CLI is open source. Committed 91225. CLI prep means beta is near. I cannot wait. Next, there is a new state-of-the-art benchmark on the ARC prize for V1. 79.6% 6% at $842 per task and on V29.4% at $3040 per task. Custom submissions by Gerber 888 and Eric Pang. Both are open-source use Gro 4 and implement program synthesis outer loops with test time adaptation. If you're not familiar with what that is, drop a comment below and if you want me to explain it, just let me know. Now, the full blog post by Jeremy Berman, again, unrelated, weird that two times this has happened in a single video, but he explains how he was able to achieve it. And all of this is based on the kind of dream coder method, which basically as the model learns things, it stores what it's learned and then it's able to generalize from there. That is an overly simplistic way of explaining it. And of course, Elon Musk had to drop in and say something. He reposted with Grock 5 training starts in a few weeks which is great news to hear but what does Grock 5 actually mean? Is that just every time they do a major training run they have to iterate on the version number? I don't know. Next do you remember Google announced agentto agent? It was a protocol that allowed agents to communicate with each other. Now they have AP2 agent payment protocol. This allows two agents to transact with each other. So announcing agent payments protocol, an open shared protocol that provides a common language for secure compliant transactions between agents and merchants. So not only can the agents actually pay each other, but the agent can pay different merchants as well. AP2 can be used as an extension of the ADA protocol and MCP learn more about how it works. And as you can see here, they already have a ton of partners lined up. So your agent is going to be able to pay for these services soon enough. So I see Adobe, Accenture, One Password, Into it, Red Hat, Salesforce, Octa. These are the biggest of the big names on the internet right now. And next, we're starting to get glimpses into what FE Lee, also known as the godmother of AI, has been working on at World Labs. So check this out. This is a 3D fully generated environment that you can play with right now. I'll drop a link down below. Now, they still have a wait list to be able to generate your own worlds and all you have to do is load up a single image and it will generate an entire world based on that image. But again, it's still on weight list. So, get your name on the wait list if you're interested in trying it out. But just from that single image, as you can see here, it is a massive world that has been generated and you can traverse and navigate through that world to your heart's content. All the details are there. It is truly incredible. I cannot wait to see what they do with this technology. And next, Tongi Labs has launched Tong Yi Deep Research. According to the post, first fully open-source web agent to achieve performance on par with OpenAI's deep research with only 30 billion parameters and only three billion of them activated. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results, scoring 32.9 on humanity's last exam, 45.3 on browser comp, and 75 on the Xbench deep research benchmark. Let's take a look. So, here it is. Here's Deep Seek. We have Kimmy, I believe that is Gemini, Open AAI, and so on. And this is just performing so so well. Humanity's last exam, Gaia, Frame, Simple QA, Browser Comp. So, you can check out the benchmarks yourself. I'll drop a link down in the description below. And continuing our Tong Yi deep research agents capabilities are built upon a novel automated multi-stage data strategy designed to create vast and highquality agentic training data without relying on costly human annotation. This seems to be the trend of really being able to scale up. You have to remove the human from the loop in the training and the reinforcement learning steps. So, it's fully open source. You can download it right now and try it out. Again, I'll drop everything in the description below. And a quick thanks to Dell Technologies for sponsoring this portion of the video. Dell Technologies has a family of incredible laptops called the Dell Pro Max featuring Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell chips, which are portable AI workh horses. It comes in 14 and 16in screen sizes and up to 32 GB of GPU memory. Perfect for onthe-go AI workloads. Check them out. Link in the description below. All right, next in what seems like a no-brainer, Whimos are coming to SFO. That is San Francisco International Airport. Whimos I have fallen in love with. But one of the big problems is when you fly into SFO, you can't get them at the airport. So you're using an Uber and then in the city you can use Whimos. But now, according to the mayor of San Francisco, the airport has approved a pilot permit to begin autonomous rides. This roll out will happen in phases and we'll keep you updated every step of the way until anyone can request a Whimo ride right from SFO. And if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, you may have seen Whimo's competition Zuks, the company by Amazon, has been really going hard and testing their autonomous vehicle very futuristic all over San Francisco. And apparently GPT5 Codeex was much more popular than OpenAI ever thought. I feel like this is a recurring conversation we keep having. Every time OpenAI drops something, they're like, \"Oh, we didn't think it was going to be so popular.\" And well, why not? It's amazing. And so, it's much more popular, which means they actually had to slow it down. So, Alexander and Bericos, who runs Codeex at OpenAI, says, \"Demand for GBT5 codecs is higher than forecasted. We need to stand up more GPUs.\" In the meantime, Codex is running 2x slower than targets. Working on fixing this ASAP. Now, remember when we were talking about tokens? Remember when we're talking about infrastructure buildout? This is the reason we need it and we need it now. The infrastructure investment is not slowing down anytime soon. Every time a new product launches, people eat it up and that is only going to increase in velocity. All right, in the next story, I'm not sure how I feel about this. YouTube announced that they are rolling out the ability for creators to create YouTube shorts with AI. The V3 fast model is now going to be available in YouTube and so you can easily just generate clips and I feel a tsunami of AI slop coming to YouTube and so it's going to be interesting to see how Google handles this. Some of these AI videos that have been created with VO have gone absolutely viral on YouTube, on Instagram, on Tik Tok, but it's just once the novelty wears off, I suspect it's just going to be seen as slop. They're going viral now and people love them now because again it's novel, but at a certain point we're going to need taste. Somebody's going to need to create a great experience, a great video, a great song from all of the AI output. Next, Hunan announces Hunan 3D 3.0 featuring 3x higher precision, a higher geometric resolution, 3.6 billion voxal ultra HD modeling for stunning details. What does that actually mean? Well, you can create 3D models. Creates faces with lifelike facial contours and natural poses, creating truly realistic highfidelity models. Precisely interprets input images to reconstruct complex structures using a layer generation strategy and generates ultra clear professional-grade details with enhanced texture fidelity and alignment for immersive true toes visuals. So, if you are a designer, if you are a creator, go check this out. All right. And in another example of humanoid robots blowing my mind, look at this video. So, not only are we seeing the robot be abused by a human, but the speed at which it gets up off the ground is really stunning. So, it doesn't seem like we're that far away from really actually having a robot UFC type thing. And I just not a huge fan of kicking and punching all these robots, you know, just in case they can actually remember these things and become sentient in the future. So, that's it for today.

          "transcript": "Artificial intelligence is spreading faster than electricity, PCs, and even the internet. This is all from a new report that Enthropic just dropped with how AI is affecting everything from jobs to different states, different countries, how they're using it, what they're using it for, everything. And it's fascinating. Let me show you. And this video is brought to you by Code Rabbit. More on them later. AI differs from prior technologies and its unprecedented adoption speed. In the US alone, 40% of employees report using AI at work, up from 20% in 2023, 2 years ago. So we have doubled the usage, doubled the adoption in the US in just 2 years. And listen to this, historically new technologies took decades to reach widespread adoption. Electricity took over 30 years to reach farm households after urban electrification. Now there's a lot of differences between AI adoption and electricity. First of all, it was necessary to have huge infrastructure buildout for electricity and the electricity really had to reach the last mile which is the home. Now with AI, obviously there needs to be huge infrastructure buildout, but it's much more concentrated and a lot of these companies already had some infrastructure buildout, but we're talking about decades compared to single-digit years. The first mass market personal computer reached early adopters in 1981, but did not reach the majority of homes in the US for another 20 years. So again, this is being adopted. This is moving more quickly and evolving more quickly than any other technology in history. And AI isn't just automating existing tasks anymore. It's actually creating whole new categories. And listen to this, the share of tasks involving creating new code more than doubled, increasing by 4.5 percentage points. So from 4.1% to 8.6%. 6%. And interestingly, debugging and error correction tasks actually went down. This may suggest that models have become increasingly reliable, such that users spend less time fixing problems and more time creating things in a single interaction, and educational institutions and research institutions seem to be using AI more and more, which is fantastic. While computer science and mathematical tests still dominate overall usage at 36%, we're seeing sustained growth in knowledge intensive fields. Obviously, if it's very knowledge intensive, that's exactly what AI does very well. Educational instruction and library tasks rose from 9% to 12%. Life, physical, and social science tasks increased from 6 to 7%. Meanwhile, the relative share of business and financial operations tasks fell from 6 to 3% and management dropped from 5 to 3%. And so, you might be asking, why are those things decreasing? their explanation. This divergence suggests AI usage may be diffusing especially quickly among tasks involving knowledge synthesis and explanation. This was really besides for code generation the first use case in the business world. That means I'm going to load up a PDF and ask it to explain it to me. I'm going to have it create some kind of document. I'm going to have it look through all of these documents and ask questions to it. And this is just such an easy, straightforward, high-value use case that everybody adopted it super quickly. And here we can see the trends itself. So you can see life, physical, social sciences, business and financial operations percentage decreasing. And remember this is the usage share trend. So of the overall pie of use cases, this is how each one is trending. Architecture and engineering decreasing quickly, management decreasing quickly, education, instruction and library increasing and computer and mathematical staying pretty consistent. And how people are using AI is changing. Automation versus augmentation. At a high level, we distinguish between automation and augmentation modes of using Claude. Automation means interaction patterns focused on task completion. You give it a task and you expect the AI to complete it entirely with no human in the loop or very little. Augmentation means you're working with AI to complete a task. Collaborative interaction patterns, learning, task iteration, and validation. And what do we see? Augmentation is decreasing and full automation is increasing. And that's also reflected in what they call directive conversations, which means you're telling AI what to do. So, for example, write me an essay about pickle ball versus here's an essay that I wrote. Can you make some improvements? That is collaborative versus directive. And because learning AI tools is so critically important for your future, let me tell you about today's sponsor, Code Rabbit. Code Rabbit is the AI code review platform, transforming how engineering teams work by allowing them to ship faster with AI without sacrificing code quality. Quality code reviews are critical but time consuming. Code Rabbit acts as your AI co-pilot, providing instant code review comments and potential impacts of every pull request. Beyond just flagging issues, Code Rabbit provides one-click fix suggestions and lets you define custom code quality rules using a GP patterns, allowing Code Rabbit to apply those to your pull requests. That'll allow you to catch subtle issues with your code that traditional static analysis tools might miss. Code rabbit is available in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. And the best part, Code Rabbit is free for all open source projects. So check out Coderabbit today. The links are down below. coder rabbit.link/matthew and that'll let them know that I sent you. So please check them out. And thanks again to Code Rabbit for sponsoring this video. And now back to the video. And you might be thinking, okay, well, if automation is increasing, that means we're going to start seeing a lot of job loss. Now you know how I feel about that. I am very optimistic. I think there's going to be a lot of job transformation, but I still think if you learn these tools and if you're watching this channel, you're probably already ahead of the game. But if you learn these tools, you will be well ahead of the game. And according to their research, you will be higher paid. Workers most able to adapt to new AI powered workflows are likely to see greater demand and higher wages. In other words, AI may benefit some workers more than others. Now, what people have been saying from the very beginning of this new AI wave is AI is not going to replace you. A person who uses AI is going to replace you. So, just keep that in mind. Learn these tools. And from all of the AI leaders that I've spoken with, the common sentiment is yes, the best thing you can learn right now is how to use these AI tools. It may lead to higher wages for those with the greatest ability to adapt to technological change, even as those with lower ability to adapt face job disruption. And according to a paper referenced here, clear evidence that entry-level workers with high AI exposure have had relatively worse employment prospects since late 2022. Setting aside questions of causality, the straightforward interpretation is that this is due to AI substituting for work previously done by early career workers and relatively faster employment growth for experienced workers reflects AI making such workers more productive and thus in high demand. So if you're early in your career, you might have more trouble getting a job. But I don't think that's going to last forever. I think once all of the dust settles, once companies really learn to adopt AI, they're going to need more humans to prompt to verify, to review the work. And even though that takes more experience in the niche that somebody's in and whatever category of role they're in, just being knowledgeable about how to use the AI tools is probably going to set you up for success. So, if you're early in your career, once again, I'm going to say it, go learn these tools. All right. What about by country? Which countries are benefiting the most? Which countries are falling behind? Well, look at this. These are the top 20 countries by anthropic AI usage index. And this is per capita. Israel by far has the most per capita usage of claude. Singapore also. And basically what that means is smaller, very technically advanced countries seem to be adopting AI much more quickly. According to the paper, the results reveal a striking pattern of concentration among small technologically advanced economies. Israel leads global per capita claude usage with an anthropic AI usage index of seven. Meaning its working age population uses cloud seven times more than expected based on its population. Then Singapore and Australia, New Zealand and South Korea round out the top five. Now in global share of usage, of course, the United States being more technically advanced and also having a huge population sees the highest percentage of usage across the globe. India being number two. Clot adoption overall is highly geographically concentrated in terms of total global usage. The United States accounts for the highest share 21.6% with the next highest usage countries showing significantly lower shares. India 7.2, Brazil 3.7. However, concentration is affected by population of the country. All right. But how are people actually using it? What are the trends for how they're using these tools? As we move from lower to higher adoption countries, claude usage appears to shift away from programming dominant tasks, which is really the most dominant task for AI right now, to a more diverse mix of tasks, though the overall pattern is noisy. You can see per country how people are using it. So, check this out. In the United States, provide comprehensive cooking, nutrition, and meal planning assistance. That is number one. Help with job applications, resumes, and career documents. So of the top over represented requests, none of them in the US are for coding which is very interesting. Look at this. Provide personal relationship and life guidance support. But then if we look at India, India fix and improve web and mobile application UI. Half of all of India's AI usage is for coding. Brazil provide translation service and comprehensive language learning assistance across multiple languages. Vietnam help with cross-platform mobile app development, debugging and feature implementation. So you can see India and Vietnam all about coding. Brazil and United States more general use cases. Now here's another interesting finding. Markets in which have higher adoption rates for artificial intelligence, specifically Claude, tend to use Claude more as a collaborator versus just handing it the wheel and making it do everything. Markets with less adoption are the opposite. they have AI and specifically Claude take the wheel and do everything. And so that gives me even more hope that as people learn to use AI, as we kind of get to the cutting edge of use cases, they're figuring out, okay, humans are needed in the loop. Now, here's AI usage in US corporations. And as you can see, it's increasing and increasing pretty quickly, but it's still a very small number. At its current point, it is nearly at 10%. That means one out of every 10 companies is using AI. That screams to me that there is so much potential for somebody who knows AI to go in and implement it at a company, whether as a consultant or an employee. If you're an employee at your company and you see your company as not using AI, go learn the AI tools and show them how to do it. You will become insanely valuable. Now, of course, if your company is in the information sector, there's a much higher adoption rate, but it's still only 25%. One in four information sector companies are using AI. It's insane to think about. But remember, we're in this little bubble where everybody knows about AI. Everybody talks about AI, but outside of our little bubble, really, nobody knows about it. People hear about chat GPT and that's about it. They don't know what's possible. And so, it's our job to go help them figure out what's possible. It's our job to go implement AI at businesses. So, some more data about how companies are using AI. 77% of AI transcripts show automation patterns, especially full task delegation, versus just 12% for augmentation. But, of course, that makes sense. If you're going through the API, there's probably going to be much less human interaction. Based on a sample of conversations from Claude AI, so that's the UI, the split between automation and augmentation is nearly even. Looking across economic tasks, the degree of cloud automation through the API is even starker. 97% of tasks show automation dominant patterns in API usage compared to only 47% in cloud AI. Programmatic API access naturally lends itself to automation. Businesses provide context. Claude executes the task and the output flows directly to end users or downstream systems. And it turns out companies don't really care about cost all that much right now. They just want good results. Overall, we find a positive correlation between cost and usage. Higher cost tasks tend to have higher usage rates. When something's working, you're going to double down. I believe this is just Jevon's paradox being highlighted. The positive correlation between cost and usage suggests that cost plays an immaterial role in shaping patterns of enterprise AI deployment. Businesses likely prioritize use in domains where model capabilities are strong and where cloudpowered automation generates enough economic value in excess of API cost. And what is the biggest bottleneck? Well, you can probably guess it's context. How do you provide these models with the context of your business, of your personal life in the most effective way? Context constrains sophisticated use. Our analysis suggests that curating the right context for models will be important for high impact deployments of AI in complex domains. This implies that for some firms costly data modernization and organizational investments to elicit contextual information may be a bottleneck for AI adoption. So we have all of this unstructured difficult to use information and we need to get it to a place in which we can provide it to AI really well. This is probably why they changed the term prompt engineering to context engineering because providing the context is the hard part. Writing the prompt is kind of the easy part at this point. But it's not all good. What does this mean for the earth as a whole? If the productivity gains are larger for high adoption economies, current usage patterns suggest that the benefits of AI may concentrate in already rich regions. Rich regions are adopting it more quickly which means they will be gaining the benefits more quickly and then it's kind of a snowball effect at that point. The rich countries will get richer possibly increasing global economic inequality and reversing growth convergence seen in recent decades. Their study also suggests that as I said earlier, if you learn AI, you will likely become more valuable. If AI automation improves the productivity of workers with tacit organizational knowledge, as some of our evidence suggests, then more experienced workers could see rising demand and higher wages even as entry-level workers face worse labor market prospects. And so, it does seem according to this research, it's not just enough to know the tools to make you more valuable. You also have to have the organizational knowledge. And so I think this is one of those problems we're going to have to figure out for entry-level workers. How do you make them more valuable? How do you make them attractive in the job market when they don't have that organizational knowledge just yet? My guess is that if they become even better at using AI, that's the skill they're bringing in the company and then they will learn the organizational knowledge. And ultimately the economic effects of transformative AI will be shaped as much by technical capabilities as the policy choices societies make. So the policies we choose are going to be critically important for AI adoption and AI value. Now this same research paper has a really cool interactive section and you can basically segment all of this data really easily, visualize it really easily. So for example, let's look at California. And within California, we can see how people are using Claude, the different job groups, the usage rank, usage index, most frequent topics, everything. And that's broken down by the US, the state, and job type. So definitely check it out. I'm going to drop all of this in the description below. And thanks again to Code Rabbber for sponsoring this video. I'm going to drop all of their links down below. Click them, let them know I sent you, try it out. They've been a great partner.

In this video, you're going to \nsee exactly how I built it, what the tool is,   and what are the powerful features that give you \nthe ability to get more customers than just a   basic landing page. Thank you to Perspective for \nsponsoring this video. And if you stick around,   I'm going to give you a link to get this free \ntemplate on Perspective that you can use for   your own business. So, I'm going to show you just \nhow easy it is to build a really high quality and   polished funnel with Perspective. And you can go \nto Perspective with the link in the description   to do this alongside with me. What's cool here \nis Perspective isn't just another form builder.   It's designed to qualify leads, score them, and \nplug them straight into your automations. you can   sign up for a free trial, so you don't have to pay \nanything to actually build alongside with me and   see if it works for your business. So, let's go \nahead and click new funnel on the top right. And   there's a lot of templates that we can start \nwith. And there's also a blank if you want to   start from a blank template. And in this case, I \nalways like to do a blank template just when we're   getting started because it helps make sure that \nyou understand everything about the product. So,   it's a blank template and we're going to be able \nto customize it and I'm going to show you how it   works. Just off the bat, I'm really impressed with \nhow clean and nice the design of just the editor   is. I really like that and I like the how just \nlike by default the funnel looks really nice. So,   let's say we want to make a funnel that is going \nto just collect email addresses in exchange for   a discount code just as an example. So, let's \ngo ahead add the headline. Let's say get 50%   off no code MBA. And I'm going to say enter \nyour email to claiming or continue to claim.   Really simple. And then you can see there's a \nresults page as well that you can customize.   And then we also can add in different elements \nhere on the page. So, if I click new block,   you can see all of the blocks that are available \nhere in perspective. There's blocks that are more   marketing blocks. You can add more information. \nThen there's also interactive blocks which   multiple choice quiz video things like that. So \nI think I'm going to show you some templates that   utilize more of these blocks in a second just \nso you can see everything that's possible. But   let's go ahead and say we want to add interactive \nblock which is a form. So let's click on form and   then just by default that's going to pop in. \nI can delete the button that was there before.   I can delete the divider. And then inside the form \non the left side, you can change the design of the   header. We have a tracking ID for the questions. \nYou can also just change the spacing above and   below it, which is really nice. And then for the \ninputs, you can also change what we're asking for.   So there's all sorts of basically preset things \nthat you can ask for here in the form, which is   great. And then we have email and phone number. \nYou can also add inputs here by just clicking   that button and you can delete inputs as well. \nEvery element here ties back to outcomes. You   launch in minute capture better data and instantly \nsee where your leads drop off. So let's say we   don't want a phone number. I can just go ahead and \ndelete that. And then one more thing we need to do   just make sure I have a second page here. I need \nto delete that because we really only have one   page here. And then it's going to the results. And \nthen just to confirm, if we click on the button,   you can go to next page or you can just by default \npush it over to the results. I guess I'm not on   the plan that can do that, but if you upgrade, \nyou can go to specific pages dynamically. But in   our case, it's fine because we're just going to \nthe next page, which works completely fine. So,   it's linking to the next page. So, let's go \nahead and click publish. Our funnel is live.   We can click preview to just view it in basically \na perspective editor. And then you can share this   with your team and leave comments. There's so \nmany little touches that have been built into   this product which I really like. Let's go ahead \nenter in a name. We enter in an email. We'll click   the button and proceed. And then we go to the \nthank you page which is great. And let's say   I want to leave a comment. Improve thank you \npage. I can post that. And then that's there   for someone else on my team to view and resolve. \nSo that's the preview. And then if we publish it,   we can now click. And then here we are on a live \nview of this page. Cookie settings cuz it's GDRP   compliant. And then we would be able to enter in \nthe information in the exact same way. And then we   can go over to metrics. We can see how many funnel \nvisits we have, how many conversions, what's the   conversion rate, pageto page conversion, device \nsplit. Honestly, this is really cool. I could see   myself using this for different lead funnels \nthat I want to use with no code MBA or other   businesses that I'm running. So, if we go over \nto contacts, we can then see, okay, now we have   a contact. But what's cool is it has a CRM that's \nbuilt in. So, if you want to use this for sales,   let's say you're a realer, for example, and you \nhave a lead funnel. And then once you have leads   come in, you can move them into different parts \nof this funnel. You can also change the name of   each of these steps. So, there's a lot of things \nthat you can do here, which is pretty cool. Next,   we have apps. So you can basically connect \ndifferent apps to perspective. So first you   have lead notifications which is that could be \nreally important sending an email with available   details when a lead is captured in a funnel. This \nis something that you would need to upgrade to   access. We also have make which allows you to \nbasically connect your funnel in perspective to   any third party. You don't need to upgrade if you \nwant to just use something like make and connect   it to make and then build your own automation. You \nhave all of these other automations as well. Also   through Zapier you have additional automations. \nNow I'm going to show you some more template   funnels in a second, but first I did promise I \nwould share the link to get this template that   Perspective made for us specifically for this \nvideo. And you can see it's a lot more built out   and polished than the one that we just created \nto show you what's possible. So to do this,   just click the link in the description, enter in \nyour information. You'll get 30 days for free on   perspective and you will also get access to that \nlead magnet template that I just showed you. All   right, so real quick before we move on, I just \nwant to show you one more funnel, but this time   we're going to do it from a template. So let's say \nyou are a coach, you have a coaching offer. We're   going to start with this template. And again, \nonce you have your free trial, you can go in   and test out all of these templates. So here we \nare in this template. You can see it's a lot more   built out. You can even add a video. It's just \nreally polished. There is line items, list items.   You can customize all of this. And then it's \nbasically a full landing page that is built in   as a funnel. So you can think of it almost like a \nwebsite landing page. It doesn't just have to be a   very simple form. This is why I like perspective. \nInstead of building a landing page from scratch,   I can take a template, customize it, and then be \nlive in a few minutes. You can also go down to   the bottom and view it as a desktop. So this \nis what it looks like on mobile. Of course,   a lot of people are going to go to your funnel on \nmobile, but you can view it on desktop as well.   So, when you're doing a more complicated funnel, \nI definitely recommend using one of the templates   because it's just so much easier, and you \nbasically just have to enter in your information,   and it's going to look really good right off the \nbat. So, there's all these buttons. All of them   are going to the next page. It's all going through \nthe funnel. So, we can see once someone clicks   that button, it goes on to this next page, which \nbasically is going to prep the user to be ready   to enter in more information. We have a quiz that \nit's starting. We have a price range, position,   budget. So, we're getting more information about \nthe user as we go. There's an optin. This is all   really cool. I really need to think about how \nI can use this inside of note. And then there's   thank you page. Really cool. And then a video as \nwell. One thing that I didn't show you before is   this messages tab, which as you can see it's in \nbeta, but I do want to mention this. So here,   when there's an appointment booked, when the \ncontact status is new, we are sending an email.   So you can build this out to basically have some \nautomations to send an email to users when certain   things happen. And of course, in this template, \nyou can customize it fully, and when you're ready,   you can publish it to your own account. Real \nquick, let's just jump into one more cuz I was   really impressed with the last one. So, let's say \nwe want to do a webinar. So, let's start with this   template, your webinar template. Webinars can be \nused for just about any business. And here we go.   We can see really cool how it just has this all \nbuilt out. Once people would click on that link,   we go to customization just to get some more \ninformation about our users. And then to sign up,   they would enter in their information and \nthen at that point they would be signed up   and then you would have their information \nto then send them through automations like   we talked about before. Send them an email. You \ncan go into messages and by default we have this   message sent. Hope you enjoy this overview. As \na next step, click the link in the description,   copy this free funnel and test perspective free \nfor 30 days. We're building apps with AI or no   code. The fastest way to get paying customers for \nthose projects.

          "transcript": "DataButton lets you build AI apps that help you \nwork 10 times faster and perform way better in   your day-to-day. It's one of the few AI builders \nout there that helps you create internal apps   that actually helps you perform better in work. \nWhether that's as an owner or as a marketing lead   at your company, Databutton can help you create \ncustom tools that you can use inside your own   workflows. In this video, we're going to build a \nmarketing dashboard with an AI churn detector to   show you what's possible in databutton. Thank \nyou so much to DataButton for sponsoring this   video. I'm so excited to show you what is possible \nwhen we build with databutton. So, here we are in   the app builder. I've put our prompt in which \ndescribes that we want to build a marketing   dashboard with the churn detector. So, we're \ngoing to hit continue here. We can upload more   information about the app such as requirements, \nuser stories. In our case, I'm going to skip this   for now. We can always add more later. And then \nfor design inspiration, I've just grabbed a really   nice dashboard off of Dribble and we're going to \nuse that as our design inspiration here. So, let's   get started. So, here we are in our databutton \ndashboard and we have five tasks that databutton   created for us. It's already starting to work on \nthe first task here. And then on the right side,   you can see the agent is basically creating \nsubtasks inside of each task and marking them   off as it gets done. So that's something that's \nnice about databutton is that it is going to be   thinking through what it's building as it does \nit. It's also going to help debug any issues   automatically without you having to intervene. \nNow what makes databutton nice for businesses   is its ability to integrate with other services. \nSo one example of that is the open AI integration   we're going to add in. But you can also add in \nother data sources. So in this app we're using   dummy data just to show what's possible. But you \ncould build an integration with something like   Mix Panel, with something like Google Analytics to \nbring in your real business data into databutton   and then build apps around that. So we're going \nto mark the first task as done. And then what it   should do is automatically start working on our \nsecond task. Now what you always can do is type   messages and have a human in the loop to look at \nwhat's happening. You can modify it, but in this   case, we're just going to move on to the second \ntask and continue building this out. you're going   to want to stick around until task number four \nto build out the open AI connection cuz I think   that's going to be the coolest part of this build \nis building in this additional functionality. The   other thing that makes databutton nice for using \nit in a business context is it's flexible enough   for developers who understand all of the code and \neverything behind the code and the database and   what's happening. But it's also easy enough to use \nfor someone non-technical to build with it or get   something started and then pass it off to someone \nmore technical. Okay, so we finished that task as   well with setting up the database schema. You can \nalso go to users and data here at the top and you   can view and test this out. We have customers \nand daily metrics. This is just some dummy data.   Again, you can integrate with your own marketing \ntools using data bug and ask the AI to do that   to actually have your own data in here. But this \nis the dummy data here in the database. And it's   really cool that databutton can configure all of \nthis for us. And if we go to the preview tab here,   we can see the pages that it created already. We \ncan see the components, UI, files, APIs, library.   So everything here is accessible. You can see \nboth the preview and you can also edit the code   directly. So we finished this third task. So we \ncan complete that. And now we're moving on to what   I am most excited about is building the AI churn \ndetector. And this is where we can really show   off data buttons capabilities of integrating with \nother services. So, it's asking if I have an API   key. So, I'm going to say yes, I do have an API \nkey for Open AAI. I'm curious. I think it should   pop up here and ask me to enter it. Now I can go \nover to my other screen, go to my OpenAI account,   and if you don't have an OpenAI account, you can \ncreate one for free, and then just go to the API   keys tab, create a new secret key, and what I'm \ngoing to do is just copy that in here. And this   is basically like a password into your OpenAI \naccount. That's how API keys work. So that way   we can send messages to OpenAI and then get \na response back. So I just saved it. And what   also is nice about databutton is it saves them \nsecurely. So, it puts it into the secrets so that   your key isn't going to get leaked. So, let's go \nahead and start the task. And what it's going to   do now is start building out this AI functionality \nfeature. I'm very curious to see what this ends up   looking like. So, it says it completed this step \nfive. What I'm going to do is test this out. So,   I'm going to go to the preview tab on the top \nleft. DataButton created this authentication   component. So, the ability to sign in to our app. \nSo, let's quickly create an account. And here I   am inside of our dashboard and we can see it's \npulling in the dummy data. So it's showing us   customers MRR things like that. So we have this in \nour dashboard and then if we go over to the churn   detector and here we can see it looks like the \nAI detection is happening. We have this loading   indicator and in a second we're going to see back \nwhat the AI model is saying. So it's been loading   for a little while. What I'm going to do is send a \nscreenshot of this to our agent and just ask it to   verify if it's working. So this is where chatting \nwith the agent can be really helpful. So what I'm   asking is to add a button to start the churn \ndetection, which I think is going to be helpful   maybe in making this work, but also in helping \nus debug it if it's not running again. All right,   so now it is fixed. Something that might help \nyou if you're debugging is just to tell the AI   to review all of the code involved, which can help \nit take a step back instead of just continuing to   go down the same path that doesn't work. So this \nis very cool. Now we have a list of our customers   with a churn risk score and also a reason of why. \nSo this says very low NPS and short tenure such as   high churn risk. So a lot of it here is based \non tenure and NPS. But of course this is only   going to get better as we would add more data \ninto it. So we have this AI churn detector now   working. So I hope that you enjoyed this video \nand are thinking about how you can use databutton   for your own business. I can already see how \nbuilding these AI features on top of our data   like this churn detector or other features are \ngoing to help bring much more power to this type   of data than a spreadsheet or even other tools \nlike Google Analytics. So, you're going to be   able to customize your analysis on top of what you \nalready have. Leave a comment below to let me know   if this is something that you would use in the \nfuture.
