          "transcript": "Can you vive code an entire ecom store? Claude code with codeex design docker and player mcp. Can we make an entire ecom website from just a CSV? Let's find out together. So, I'm going to be using Woo Commerce. I actually didn't really like Woo Commerce until I had to add it to SEO growth. Now that I've actually used it a little bit, it's really interesting. Now, just before we continue, if you need any help with your SEO and you're on either Woo Commerce or Shopify, this video is sponsored by SEO Growth. SEO.ai. It's a SAS that will grow your store automatically. You can still join the wait list. There's still the special offer for our founding members, which is $99 for 3 months. Sorry, $99 a month for 3 months and then going up to $499. But yeah, basically I didn't actually realize this, but Woo Commerce is pretty damn interesting. So, what I've done is I basically just found this, which is um a load of products on uh GitHub, right? It's just an example CSV. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to see if I can make an entire website from it. So, let's just open up terminal because I just turned my computer off for the first time in a while. And let's zoom in a little bit here. And actually, we need Visual Studio Code as well. And I'll just do a new window. Yep, sure. And then file, open folder. I really need to learn how to do this without doing it manually. And we'll call this uh WordPress woocom because that's just what came into my mind. And then open that folder. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use codeex for the design here. And then I'm going to use um claw code to create the thing. So, I'm really curious to see just how good or how well this is going to work. So, let's start by giving Codeex the CSV, which obviously it doesn't accept it. So, let's go here instead. And I'm going to say, \"Please design me a homepage, a full homepage with as many design elements as possible for an ecom store selling the following products. You can use image links to really show the quality and modernity of your build. Just use HTML, CSS, JavaScript. There we go. And then I'll send the products. So, while Codeex fires up, let's actually set up Claude Code as well. The reason I'm using claude code, by the way, is because it's much better at using Docker and things like that. And also just generally it's just much better with um it's much better with uh WordPress basically. So let's CD inside uh what did I call this? WordPress com. There we go. And then let's do let's add the playright MCP first of all. So Google Right. MCP. There we go. And we'll just add this. Okay. Uh, do we need any other MCPS? I don't think so. Okay. So, uh, inside Oh, wait. Claude D- dangerously skip permissions. Okay. create a new folder called um ecom site and then inside that start a fresh docker instance uh with WordPress for development and web commerce installed. There we go. And we'll send that. So let's just check out what's going on here. Okay, it's still just doing stuff. That's fine. Let's actually just open Docker as well. Someone said that the main flex is that your Docker started in such a short amount of time. I have one of the new Macs, guys. That's probably why. I think I could run LLMs on this thing, honestly. But I think I I think when all of these active, I think I was just using 60 GB of RAM or something before I turned my computer off. Jesus. No wonder, man. No wonder it froze yesterday while I was playing League of Legends. I think that's probably on me. Okay, so we should actually just Yeah, we can basically open this already. I'm I'm going to install everything. I'm going to show you guys everything that I actually do here. So, the containers are running. Let's wait a moment for WordPress to fully initialize, then set it up. So, I'm just waiting for it to set it up for me. You could run through this manually, but I'm just going to let it do, you know, uh I'm going to let it do it itself. This is what I use claude code for, right? I just kind of want to demonstrate what I use claude code for. Um, and it's it's mainly stuff like this. Like if I want to really if so I've said just install the CLI there. So you I do keep an eye on it, right? So it said here that uh WordPress image blah blah blah doesn't have it uh installed by default. Let's install WordPress through but I don't like that. So I said just install the WordPress CLI because I want to use the WordPress CLI. So this is the kind of stuff I use it for. any shell commands, any annoying thing, MCPs, Docker, that kind of stuff, you're going to run run into huge problems trying to do that, right? If you do it with um if you do it with codecs, right? And then codeex raw power and raw ability to code is really really nice. Okay, so let's have a look. Why does it say failed? Okay, interesting. Let's just put it all in an index.html file. Okay. So, this is the the design that um Codex came out with, which is really really nice actually. Super super good. So, can we turn this into a WordPress website with one prompt? That's the question. This is this is actually insane. If I can if I can do this. This looks really, really nice. I think it could even be I think it could be even better, but like I mean compared to what you would normally get from AI, this is pretty insane. I would change the header person and stuff like that, but let's just let's just go with the flow here, right? So, there we go. WordPress is now set up. Oh, let's go to Docker. Sorry. So, let's open this. There we go. It's got uh Woo Commerce because you can see it has a checkout. Uh, let's just check what the username and password is. Sorry for flicking around. Admin. So, let's just copy the password. Okay. So, let's go to slash WordPress admin and then admin and then log in. I'm sorry, I'm not one prompting this. I'm vi coding this, I should say. Okay, so we're in. Let's see. Uh, themes. Where is themes? Appearance themes. Okay, so there's no theme or anything like that. That's fine. Okay, so let's first of all let's just attach this CSV and let's just say add these products either via CLI curl or um import CSV whatever just get them on my site right um I would personally say if you've got a lot of products do it via um uh CSV import I would say that's probably the best way to do it but if you've just got 10 products looks like this, then you can also just let it do it semianually, right? Okay. So, let's just see if this this works. It's basically created a Python script. It's converted 20 products from Shopify to Woo Commerce format. And then it should theoretically just import them all, right? So, you get maybe you can kind of see where I'm coming from, guys, but I'm very excited about this because like I didn't even know this was possible until very recently. So, can we create basically an entire business in 10 minutes? Now, that's kind of kind of the question I'm asking today, right? Okay. So, let me install a CSV importer. So, you would have had to do all this yourselves. You would have, you know, blah blah blah. I'm just sat back relaxing, feet up, and it's just doing it right now. I could just technically take this CSV that I created and just import it. So, I might just quickly see if that works. just cuz I'm curious. So, let's search for this and then wait. So, am I Yeah. Okay. Search for that. Then, can I drag this there? No. Okay. So, I just uh selected it here. Let's just see if this works. Run the importer. Your products are now being imported. Okay. So, it says 20 products imported. There we go. So, I mean, that still saved me a lot of time, right? I didn't even have to convert the files myself. And then instead of it doing that, I said, so I'll just say I just uh imported them through the admin. Can you check you have the products? So this is what the website currently looks like now that it has products, right? It's pretty obviously it it's basic, but this is kind of manu. This is automatically created by the theme, right? The product page. So there we go. It can see the products. Uh, WPWC product list. There we go. No, I don't care about that. Okay. So, now I want you to So, what I would do at this stage is I'm just going to say I want you to I don't know why it's I don't know what's wrong with my Mac recently. So, I want you to create five categories and assign products to them and then put let's just do that. I just want some categories um or for two reasons. Number one, you guys should always have categories. So, I'm just showing you that this is an important part of the process. And number two is I want them because I want to be able to display categories on the homepage and it's part of the design and therefore I just have to quickly also create some categories. Now you can see it's super super easy. It just created five categories for me in like literally 1 second. Um so if I go to categories, we should see some categories here. And now it's going to assign the products. So we'll see that in a second as well. Now, let me assign products to their appropriate categories. So, I'm basically just creating an entire business. Right now, the the main thing is can it take the design index.html and turn it into a full-blown website? That's kind of that would be the exciting thing to see. So, there we go. We now have some actual SEOable stuff. We have some categories. We have some stuff. I've been doing this for like 10 minutes, guys, and I've already got, you know, the bare bones of an entire website. Okay, so that worked good. Okay, now take the design in index.html inside your root directory, not inside uh what was it called? ecom site and use it to precisely to create a web press ecom website around that design. Um, yeah, I mean, let's just keep it simple. There we go. Wait, ultra thing here. I'm just going to say ultra think here because I have a theory that one of the reasons Codeex is so much better and Claude Code has degenerated so much is that we're not actually giving it the time to think. Right. Okay. So, seems they want me to think deeply about this. There we go. So, now I'll let this run. Uh, it's just read 1,457 lines of code. I just want to see what it actually says here. I want to see if it says it's like a manageable task or if it's going to have problems or whatever it might be. And then literally you would just add some blogs and you'd be pretty much done. This is a beautiful modern e-commerce design for rustic aura home and garden furniture decor store. The design features color scheme uh key sections interactive elements. Now I need to convert this into a WordPress theme with Woo Commerce integration. This will involve creating custom theme, converting HTML into WordPress PHP templates, marking the products dynamic using Yeah, perfect. This is exactly what I want it to do. And yeah, I could literally just go to sleep right now and hopefully wake up with a full e-commerce store. Obviously, I'd need to add things like a contact page and you know, all that, but I mean, yeah, we'll see how this does. Okay, so it's currently testing it and I just want to kind of show you guys this process. So, this is what we've got. You can see it's I'm just going to I'm just going to pause it. Actually, normally I just let it test, but I just want to see Wow. Um, this is pretty mad, guys. I I It was That That was 6 minutes. That is That is crazy. That is crazy. That was about 20 minutes in total to make this entire store. I I honestly am blown away. I'm blown away. I can't believe this is possible. I mean, it still needs a tiny bit of work. Obviously, it's not completely perfect, but I did stop it early. Um, yeah, with a little bit more prompting, guys. Like, this was simple prompting. So imagine this with a complicated prompt where you're really, you know, going at it to do all the SEO and, you know, blah blah blah make, you know, do a popup and you guys, this is this is crazy. Holy So yeah, guys, if you do end up uh using this, definitely check out segrow.ai AI if you need the SEO done for it like on a more consistent basis or honestly just vibe code it yourselves. Yeah. Uh I'm going to leave the video there guys. This is an absolute game changer. I'm not going to lie. Like you can literally just generate an entire beautiful looking ecom store in under 20 minutes which I did not think I did not have that on my bingo card. Thanks for watching guys. If you're watching all the way to the end of the video as usual you're an absolute legend and I'll see you very very soon with some more content. Holy crap. Peace out.",

          "transcript": "Hey guys, I wanted to talk about something today and I'm actually doing I'm currently running another benchmark as we speak, but I wanted to talk about how in my opinion like replet is probably done to be honest with you because I mean yeah it will always have a space and a place in people's hearts and things but just like the what's the point in this right if you can literally just say to codeex so I just ran this prompt how do you feel about making me an entire SAS I just want a homepage that looks incredibly modern, a dashboard, the five side options, the tool should be a basic AI powered CRM, blah blah blah. And it just went straight into it and it just started creating it. And now I'm just sitting and waiting to see what it actually produces. And what's the difference, right? Why would you even use replay anymore when replay is way more expensive? This might seem fairly cheap, but like you do not get like infinite usage for this. You can see pay as you go for additional usage. Pay as you go for additional usage. So you will end up paying a lot more money than you might think because you will have to use this a lot if you're creating an entire SAS. Now Codex on the other hand I am pretty sure that I'm just using my Codeex 20 bucks subscription as far as I know. Income stream Surfer Income Stream Surfer is a pro account. I'm fairly sure. Yeah. So I'm paying 23 bucks a month and I'm using Codeex and I haven't once had to I've never got rate limited nothing like and I've been using it a lot. It's not like I just use it a tiny bit. I've been using it for for Grove. I've been using it for videos. I've probably built like three different websites already and I still haven't hit any rate limits. So, I'm just starting to think like where does Replet and where does Lovable and where did Bolt even sit on this? Like what what do they do that's special? They can run your code for you. What? You can't run npm rundev so you have to pay pay as you go usage and frankly kind of ridiculous prices once you get up there. Like I remember we were paying I I think 75 bucks a month for level 50 maybe. Um and yeah it just like what do they actually do? You can connect superbase. Great. You can connect to GitHub. Wow. Like what what are we doing here? I don't know. It's weird. I I will say one thing though. This did get me into generation like bolt new and stuff. But as soon as I saw it I was like this isn't doing anything special. And now it's getting to the point where you can just prompt your own AI and just say, \"There you go, mate. Off you go. Make this for me and then, yeah, come back in a few hours.\" Now, this is the thing that really got me interested when I was I was reading this article yesterday on the on the channel on the video. I saw this here. Codec during testing, we've seen GBC5 codecs work independently for 7 hours at a time on large complex tasks. When I saw this, I thought, \"Holy this is a this is a breakthrough.\" 7 hours at a time. And I've tested this. It didn't do seven hours, obviously. Like, I don't know what the hell they prompted to get it to go for 7 hours, but like I it worked for over an hour for me on uh the example website that I made on yesterday's video. Let's just go on that video real quick. And then I just want to give a little bit of perspective on this um website that I made. So, yeah, I believe this is the correct website notes. Okay, it's this one here. So this is by far the best website I've ever seen generated by AI for sure. It's better than replay. It's better than lovable. It's better than any other. It's better than claw code. It's literally perfect as well. Like if you make this with replay, you will have issues. Something will go wrong, etc., etc. But this is literally perfect code, right? Okay. So this is saying that this is done already. I really don't know how it's managed to finish this already, but I guess we can have a look. Assembled the dashboard with sideboard notification implemented client side CRUD canban rendering auto assign documented local reimmitation. The plan currently simulates responses locally and strategies reen by CLI guidance only. No externals are made because the environment has restricted network access to serve to verify server folder statically. For example, this and open this. Uh okay. can be actually made in a working SAS instead of messing. So, this is what it created for now. Anyway, uh this does look fairly standard to be honest with you. I'm not massively happy with this, but Oh, it's got light mode, dark mode. That's crazy. Really, really cool. So, I'm guessing these are just Yeah, they're just uh anchor links, but I've just asked it to actually implement everything. So, we'll see what happens here. Okay, so again, this says this is done. I'm just going to set the end variables. Okay, so I've done that. Uh, and then for Stripe, it's it's it's not too complicated, guys. Honestly, I'll make a video about this at some point, but it's not as complicated as I thought it was. So, I'm running npm install it. For the stripe variables, you literally just need price ID and you need the developer key, which is if you just click developers down here, uh, and then go overview, then you can get all your keys that you actually need right here. So, secret key is the one that I needed this time. And then you just do stripe login using the CLI. Uh and then you do stripe listen and then you get this wh set key which is here. And then yeah you just that that's everything. Okay. So there's some kind of npm issue here. So I'm just going to grab this and send it to share gt5. Okay. So npm install worked that time. Oh, we got a crash. Oh, already in use 3000. Uh, let's change the port. Okay, so now it's listening at localhost 3006. There we go. So, this should have some functionality now. Sign in. It still doesn't let me. It doesn't let me create an account, but I didn't actually ask it to do that. So, that's okay. Let's have a look. So, let's add a client. So, this is Bob. Bob and MMR is okay. So, it says enter a valid value when I try to enter a number. Okay, so it does let me add a teammate. If I refresh this, does it save? Let's go back to team. It does. Okay, so we do have a database that's working. Open Stripe. Okay, so let's see if it actually implemented Stripe properly. First time. So we're using um if you don't know how this works, guys, we're using fake. Well, not fake, but uh test credit card information. Um and you can actually just see if this works, right? So, let's see if Stripe works first time out the box and then if it does, like what's the point in using replay? I just don't get it. I'd much rather be doing this myself. Okay, so we can see if that actually worked by going here or here. Sorry. Oh, okay. So, charge succeeded, payment method attached, invoice paid. Yeah, so it worked. We got all the Stripe information that we need. So, that'll now be in the database. And the really cool thing is it made a database using SQL Lite and it it automatically gave it persistence because if you're using SQL Lite, you're going to want persistence, right? So add task. Client's not coming up because I can't add a client. Okay, there we go. So we now after a very quick edit, we can now add a client. Let's see if that's saving. It is. So now we should be able to add a task for Bob. Um do SEO for Bob. Due date 18th. There we go. And then we refresh this again. There we go. Interesting. So, this all works. I mean, that's pretty damn impressive. You now have the building blocks to make an entire SAS. Right now, I personally I'm not going to be using this as a SAS. Obviously, I'm not going to make an AI powered CRM as a SAS. But what I am going to do is I'm going to make an AI powered CRM to manage our agency. Right? So, let's just see. Does auto assign do anything? No, it doesn't. But yeah, we we we can very quickly and very easily add new features to this. My idea behind this is basically we need to be able to run our agency using AI, right? That's the plan here. Um, oh, what is this? So, this is for Bob. Do SEO for Bob. Uh, Hish does it. Lol. Generate plan. Okay, it didn't work. Open Rita GBC. Okay, it's incorrect model name. That's fine. So, because I'm kind of getting, you know, decent at coding myself now, I know that I can just search for model here, I can look. And this needs to be open AI, I believe. That's the problem. So, we'll save that and then we'll generate again. Okay, I probably need to refresh. So, draft plan for Bob. Bob, uh, do SEO for Bob. Amish has to do it. generate plan. Uh, ready G. Oh, it's G GT5 me. There we go. That should work. Now, I don't know if it's open router or um open AI. I might have to change that again. Uh, do bot image it. Okay. Damn. So I want to just give a little bit of context before I finish this video. This might seem like a fairly basic task, but I mean people have generated entire um things like context engineering and replit and bolt new and lovable and all those things to create something that now can just be done by it can literally be done by codeex in half an hour. This is the fastest I've ever made one of these. Now, this was actually at one point one of my um benchmarks, right? My one of the benchmarks that I did was how can how quickly can you create an entire SAS, right? And now it can do it in half an hour, guys. I mean, honestly, this is this is mad. This is absolutely mad. So, for me personally, I'm not going to be making loads of SAS. I'm going to be making a few internal tools to mean that we can automate a lot of our processes. maybe make a few more SASSes down the road. I'm not sure yet. But if you want to build a SAS, use Codeex right now. It's insanely powerful. I'll leave the video there, guys. Thank you so much for watching. If you're watching all the way to the end of the video, you are an absolute legend. And I'll see you very, very soon with some more content. Peace out.",

And so in this video, I'm going to be breaking down the complete process for any beginner coming into AI to be able to go from zero to $100,000 and the five key challenges that you're going to face along the way and the solution to each of these different roadblocks. Sweet, man. Great to great to see you. I'm so excited to jump into this cuz that 0 to 100K is what everyone's after right now and you've just recently gone through that process. So, we're going to be breaking down um the five key steps that you've got in between here and there. And uh you've got a ton of source in there, guys. If you got don't know Kelly, he's been absolutely crushing it. I've been watching his story for a while now. Came up through my accelerator and he's just been going from strength to strength. The way he's doing his content on LinkedIn, uh the way he's sourcing this like the strategy he approached learning the skills with is actually really really smart as well. So, Michael, mate, it's great to have you on here and I can't wait to to share what you've got to got to share with these guys. or if you just want to give us a bit of a framing on on your journey and how you sort of come to the the realization on a lot on a lot of these before we jump in. So what you see here on the screen is the road to 100k and all the problems that I had to go through along the way and I broke them down into the five key steps five five key milestones that I had to go to get to the 100k because it is one of the most important steps at least for me um to then be able to to go down in different directions but I feel like these cover mainly what most people really go through when they go to uh to build an AI automation agency and so on. Yeah, for sure. I mean, there's uh these are the exact things I I have to answer again and again and again and again on calls. Um, and it's going to be so great for people to see this contextualized of basically taking the playbook that I've been screaming at everyone to do for so long and you giving us the actual screenshots of those messages that you're sending out and the examples of the post you're doing. So, I'm super super excited to jump into this, man. All right. So, the first up here is really just learning AI. So, this is the first milestone when you get into the whole space. I feel like this is where you get the most overwhelmed because you get introduced to all the different tools that are out there. In this case for me, I was introduced to Voppy uh voice flow make.com lovable and again you were one of the YouTubers that I that I was watching over time uh because you were introducing all the different tools and you're talking about the AI automation agency model uh and I was so so excited and when I jumped into the AAA which is where I really got started with the with the whole sort of journey I was introduced to all the different tools and I was overwhelmed because there's so many different things to focus on and I didn't really know what to do at that point. Um and that was that all the time. Exactly. And and that was I mean focus is one of the hardest things to have especially in the space because there's so many things you can do, so many things you can focus on. So for me that was a that was a key step that I had to go through. So what I did for me I actually spent a few weeks diving deep into each software to understand more so the space but also what each software did and the function that it played around how to build a business with it and then through Casey which is one of the success managers at AAA he told me if you just lock in and focus on one thing and that was make.com in that case work for automations and that's the thing that I decided to is jump in. remember I did a video I think it was in like end of um like middle of 2024 or something and it was like the five different ways to start an AI agency and it was basically the same thing. There's these different areas that you can specialize in. There's there's a voice agents. There was like I mean you could even go do Zap Zappia ecosystem and get really good at that. You could just do the workflow part of things. Um or you could do the textbased agents and chat bots. And I think what was really really helpful for a lot of people in the same way that it is for you here to just like cut out the noise and just pick one area because they're all like if you just focus on voice agents you can become very good at them and there's so much money to be created in that space right now. Likewise with workflow automations or if you want to be doing I think the custom software and vibe coding one is a great path to get into as well now. So taking that down from thinking you need to be like a general agency and be able to do everything to just being like this is my area of expertise and and I can learn that stuff which is is so important for beginners to know 100%. And it's so easy to just like focus on all of them because you just you just like you're missing the opportunity if you don't focus on all of them rather than just d each one which is exactly what I felt because I was I was learning everything one day. The interesting thing about workflow automations is is I call it's kind of like the meta skill cuz all you use it across everything. So even if you're building textbased agents you may still be like orchestrating that with with a with a workflow platform like make. Um, or if you're doing voice agents, you might be doing your tools on something like uh like make or you might be doing it on NA10 and the same kind of transferable skills. So, I still think that workflow automation base is is really really solid. 100%. Especially as someone who came in with no technical knowledge. I think the fundamental skill here is like APIs, understanding how apps talk to each other. And the skill you're learning is not make.com, it's workflow automations. And that's something you use across the whole board. Uh so that's and understanding how like software talks to each other like APIs is is the core of everything we do these days um across all even if you're putting custom software on lovable it's like okay well I've got this cool looking front end how am I going to get it to do anything okay well I understand that my my automations would have to send API requests around so maybe I can get some workflow automation or like some uh some tool that I create and then hook it into our API and it's just like everything is built on top of of that ability 100% I think that's something you you learn over time like what fundamental skills you actually need to learn. Uh but that was really really key for me. So what I did essentially was just niche down as much as possible. AI automation was is already a niche within AI to niche down to one subset of AI automation which is work for automations. And to be able to learn these tools um people over complicate this. They think they need a course. They think they need to find some some fancy software to go out there and learn these tools. But what I learned is just YouTube is the best place that you can probably learn all these all these sort of softwares and stuff. Nowadays as well there's so much of this content around on YouTube now. like the the amount of AI automation training content. I put out full courses here on the channel um on basically everything the AI agents, AI automations and vibe coding and all these things. I have full courses and then every there's channels that are just specialized in each of these different areas as well. So if it's like oh I haven't got the money to start this, it's just it's just not even an excuse anymore. 100% 100%. Especially for me cuz I literally had zero had zero dollars. And by the way, just so you know, like when I joined the accelerator, I didn't have any money. I asked my sister to give me 80% of what she had and my dad as well and I put it onto the accelerator and I went full in all in all in um and that that was that was the key for me and the thing that actually got me started as well was your chap videos like you were posting chap videos on voice flow. So that was the thing I found on YouTube as well that you can just simply just learn and just get going right away. So the second step here after learning AI and getting started once you know your sort of niche within the AI automation space you know that you're doing work for automations then it's about how can we get our first client clients right and for me at the start initially it was just about working for free for the first three clients before actually pricing any client before asking for money uh and for me it's just because of experience that I wanted to get but also just to get going getting the momentum going I feel like early on you want some quick wins you want something to to keep you going uh because that keeps you motivated and so on. Yeah, 100%. I mean, the free the free strategy, I get into a bit of a a difficult situation with some people like obviously you're young, you've got you've got time on your hands, you've got energy, and you wanted to do the fundamentals and learn learn from the ground up. When there's other side of the auto AI automation space or or people wanting to get into AI businesses are people with jobs and they want to do it as a side hustle and they want to come in and not necessarily do all that ground work and have like a really solid skills base. So, it's it's always a bit tricky whether for younger people like us or maybe people who are time rich. uh definitely doing all the learning, the fundamentals, and then working your way up through free clients to paid clients. It's just a very logical progression. Uh but then some people do come in and say, \"Oh, I don't really want to do all of that work. I'd rather just kind of be the be the connector or be the marketer.\" And that is that is possible, but this is definitely like 100% the the guaranteed way. I call it like the the slow way to get rich with AI is to do this path to learn the fundamentals and like you will absolutely get there. Um but it might not be as rapid as as you expect because you do have to go through free clients gradually increase your prices. Um which is exactly what you've done. I mean it's just doing the unscalable before you scale right and for me it was like 19 team with so much time like you mentioned no responsibilities. I've talked to 45 year olds who are trying to get in the space and I understand their point of view when they say they don't want to work for free because they have something to lose. They have responsibilities. So it just makes sense um on that end. But I feel like this is still the first step just to get experience to get the momentum going. I actually dropped the email that I actually sent to my first uh to my first prospect, which was a a guy that I knew from an agency that I work with. Um I just told him, \"Hey, I just wanted to to help you out. Um can you help on a call?\" That was basically it. And this was 5 days after 6 days after I saw your videos, the first video on on automation. And I was like, \"Okay, this is this is so sick. Let me just do it. Let me just jump in. Keep moving.\" Um didn't know anything. Did literally zero idea what anything was. Just send a message because why not? And these are other messages as well. And the warp network is legit like the the thing that I really emphasize on this is just reaching out or maximizing your your contact list. So go through your contacts and just message each person that you know. And I was 19 by the way. I had when someone told me this to to reach out to my word network. I was like the first objection I had was I know I know no one like no friends are mine. I'm business owners. I have no friends who are business owners. Literally nothing. Um once you dig deep into it like you find that your sister's boss is a restaurant owner and your sister's friend's dad is another business owner. Uh and go from there. This is so so important to point out and I I have to I keep answering these same questions as well. It's like oh but I don't know anyone. I say you need to get your first clients for more marriage. If you just ask people around you and you make enough noise and let people know there are people in your network um who not either they themselves need it. So you have your first degree connections and then in this case it's like someone you know who knows someone. So here you've got like your uh your sister's uh your sister's connection, right? Um so that's a second degree connection. So instead of saying, \"Oh, I only know young people or students um and none of my family have a business.\" It's like, \"No, who do they know?\" Ask them, \"Hey, hey, mom, dad, hey, or like my auntie or your uncle or whatever it is.\" Is there anyone that you know would be interested? I do this stuff now. And so I think it's so helpful for people to see these screenshots right here. Um if you've ever wondered how to do it or how to actually reach out to people like that, something I wanted to start, I was like, what do people even say when they reach out to the world network? This is exactly the text message. I mean, it's nothing crazy. Like none of this is crazy. It's just reaching out to people that you know. Usually the way I would frame it um if you're 19 with no network and you have nobody to know, you just frame it as like do you have do you know do you happen to know anybody who'd be interested to just help or like help with and if they are interested themselves they'll say yeah I'd like that but if not then then you get access to their second degree connections as well. So it's this is the whole Aussie war outreach strategy. It's not like I've invented it. Uh it it works so just do it. And that's at the start that's what you have to do at the start. I mean, I think that's a non-negotiable unless you just just get so much traction that you need need to get free clients. But I think like this is a really Yeah, any other route the the school community one you're about to break down is is a really good one as well. But if the fastest way to get your first one, two, three clients is going to be through that warm warm network you've got. It's just faster. Like you can do it tomorrow. You know what I mean? If you know someone, you can just do it tomorrow. Max out your contact list, go through each one and just you will get something like I can guarantee you just each one. Yeah. I've actually got a full guide on the warm outreach, guys. I I'll link that down below. Um you guys can just grab that breaks down the whole strategy that uh that Mel's using there. The next strategy for me was school community. Uh so I actually joined your your free school community. I mean now it's insane actually the amount of people that are there. Um but this for me it was like where do I go where people are asking for for work and because you were like the the guy that was just doing all these things and had a free community and a lot of people just joined. So, in your job board hiring, there were a lot of people who were asking for jobs, asking for work, like, \"Hey, do you know someone who's able to to do XYZ?\" And this is the the job post that I saw from a guy who's actually my friend now. Uh he was my first um my second client in this case, and he was looking for a chatbot guy, boys. Uh and I just DM'd him and said, \"Hey, I'm from the UK. I build chat bots. Uh can we help on a call?\" And that was pretty much that second client. And just like that, again, another thing I've been yelling at people to do is like if you there's we have like 500 to sometimes a thousand people per day coming into that community. They're either posting in the introductions and saying, \"Hey, like I'm XYZ. Um I do this and you could just reach out and make a connection or the hiring channel where there's people looking for either looking for developers or they're they have a specific project in mind.\" So, if you actually go in there and and at the same time, if you grind a bit of sort of clout within the community and you start to post and like create a bit of share a bit of value, um being the go-to people or notable in that community is there's there's so much business you can get off the back of that. So, it's great to see this being being like actioned on and seeing results from it because I know that hiring board has got so much source in it. I think it's so underrated. I mean, especially because there's 200 plus K people in the in the community and some posts don't even get any comments or one to two comments. like there's so much opportunity out there um that you can just take action on. So these two were the the different strategies that I used to get my first clients clients in this case the first two uh for free war reach and then school community and do you want to just give us a an insight to you maybe be a bit vulnerable what was it really like doing those first few clients bro like did you feel out of depth or did you feel that you'd prepared well enough with the with the material you've been through on learning automations like what was going through your head at that at that point it was horrible I didn't know anything I just hopped on a call uh I just told them that I do chat bots and I was like I can make your chatbot better And then we went on the call, we went off the call and I was meant to use make.com as well for like the chatbot. And I had zero idea how to do it. And I had basically had to spend three four days going on authorizations with the client and he got pissed off and he ghosted me. Um, so like that was the that was the first. So that's that's setting up the setting up the accounts on make. Yeah. On Hopspot, on voice flow, on web hooks. I didn't know what a web hook was at that time. Uh, just zero. He just goes to me time. So yeah. I mean, for for the beginners, what's the best way that you've uh there's there's a bunch of different ways of approaching it, but for those initial setups, like do you have Loom videos now? Do you have a a like SOP that you pass over to the client for setting them up on certain platforms or giving you access? Like what's the way that you've refined that? I think for me, uh the the way that you I like to hop on calls like I've tried different things. I've tried sending Loom videos on because I already had tutorials and hey, here's how you can make your Make.com account. Here's how to connect your your Google Sheets to make.com. But I found that even with showing a step-by-step video, the client still has questions. So you you might as well just go on a call with them and just walk them through. Hey, share your screen. Click here, click there, connect this, connect that, and then it's just better. Even if you invest that one hour, it would be there anyways. All right, cool. Now we can get to getting more clients. So now we got free clients. We got the first the second client. How can get more people to know about our stuff? Um, in my opinion, when I first got started, the thing for me was content. That's the thing that I saw you do and that really inspired me to just just post content as soon as possible because content is actually one to many which means that you can make one content or one piece of content it can go to a million of people. So you can get a lot of stuff uh from there. Now when you get when I got introduced to content I got introduced to medium, YouTube, LinkedIn X and and Instagram and one thing that I find a lot of times that people try to stretch themselves out and just do everything and that's something that I did at the start as well. Uh because I did YouTube, I did LinkedIn, I did I think Medium. I had no I literally I was doing everything. Um and thankfully I had people like Casey who told me, \"Hey man, stop messing about just just focus on one platform and just do it do it really well.\" Yeah, this is like a chronic beginner issue and I I always try to hammer at home, but just like one is enough. Uh even for me like I'm I barely post on LinkedIn. We're starting to post a bit more um to talk about what we're doing at Morningside. Uh X we've just started posting on consistently. Instagram I basically never post and medium I've never done. Like if you just do one platform and do it really well. Um particularly the big ones like if you're just doing YouTube really well or just doing uh LinkedIn. I've seen guys doing short form content on Instagram and getting tons of leads for their agency and their school communities through through short form on Instagram. Um and I'm sure you could do the same on on Twitter. Like I don't really think there's anyone really running the running the X uh the X space when it comes to a automation agencies and things like that. So if you just pick one and do it well. uh with even guys in the accelerator doing the medium strategy and just posting on medium and getting tons of leads for your agency like that. So, but you just got to pick one and do it well because there's that skill curve of like actually getting deep in the platform and realizing, okay, what are the trending formats? Okay, I've done enough of these posts now that oh, this one popped off and you just start following these little grains of truth from the data that you get back on your post. Um, which I'm sure is what you're going to you're going to break down now. So, for me, okay, so I got introduced all these platforms. My decision on why I chose LinkedIn was based on where do the people that I want to target where do they hang out and what was I most comfortable using at the time and so the LinkedIn content that I had the strategy behind it is something is the reason why I booked over 300 400 calls uh just off of organic content and it was uh separated into three different types of posts. The first one is the automation videos which is to show your expertise. The second one is lead magnets to provide good stuff for free. And then the third one is personal uh show that you're just human that you have a story that you're not that you just have feelings and stuff. So that that's the main uh thing about content and that part of side. Now the automation videos itself what they are and what I did then is just got as many nodes on the screen as you could that's the hook. The crazier the crazier it looks. It's like the NA10 ones now is like the crazier the the the scenario or the workflow looks. But yeah, I mean it stops the scroll, doesn't it? Exactly. It just hooks them. Um, so YouTube was where I learned. So I learned YouTube and then I actually posted on LinkedIn. This is this was crazy to me. I was I was watching YouTube videos building automation. I was making them with them. So I was actually learning through the process and I was posting it on LinkedIn and then I got clients. That for me was like just a crazy process that I had to go through because it just people over complicate this so much. You just learn, post what you learn and then just do it over and over and over again. That's what I call like the the potential framework. I think you would have seen in the accelerator as well, but there's this very very powerful upward spiral that I I got stuck in and and you've got stuck in and anyone else who's who's really succeeding in the space get stuck in, which is you realize there's when you start doing content off the back of your skills acquisition. Like when you learn a certain thing, you are like you're not just learning in isolation. You are learning for the sake of content and then that can help you to get leads and then those leads convert into clients and then those clients give you learnings and then you can talk about that in your content again. So, it's this like powerful upward spiral where like some people will just learn in isolation and learn learn learn and then they'll try to like go and market whatever they've learned. But if you're learning and creating content at the same time, um, and just really really exploring your own curiosities and like how how far can I push this tech, that was like the biggest secret for me was just finding something that I was totally nerding out about and I just wanted like it felt like play to me cuz I was just cooking up this awesome stuff and then I made a video about it and like that that I'm sure you can agree is when you get into that like real playful zone is when you make your best content and it's when you're making content that's really pushing the the the boundaries of the space and that's what's actually unique. The lesson with content that I if if you just do this like you'll just succeed is post content as you get good not when you get good. That's like the main thing that you just mentioned here is like like no one like just document what you're doing because there's no real experts in the industry. I actually feel like there's no real experts. This only came out like two years ago. Um so that's why uh I think that's that's important. So automation videos is just to show your expertise. This is you building an automation and showing hey guys this is the automation I built. This is what it does. And fundamentally like when I started I was working with zero clients. So I wasn't showing any automations that I built for clients. I was just showing automations that I just built for fun, you know. And that's what I I think one of the the roadblocks that I got started with. I was like, \"Okay, but I post videos. How like I have no clients. How can I post videos about automations I never built clients?\" Personal projects. I I keep shouting from the roof about that as well. Like if you're looking to get started, find some personal projects. Like talk to the GBT and get it to like help you pull some ideas out. But there's some personal projects either if you're doing voice agents, if you're doing workflow automation, if you're doing like textbased agents, there are some personal projects that you can do. Yeah. And because of the fact that we're targeting business owners, the the thing to understand is like business owners don't have the time to set it up, but they have the time to be on their phones, look at what's possible in the space to then reach out to you uh for help. And that's like the the thing. Now, the second part is lead magnets. Now, if I were to uh point the success that I had on LinkedIn, it probably was on the lead magnets that I made. So lead magnets fundamentally comes from the fact that you're playing within LinkedIn's algorithm. So the way it works is that you make a post, let's say Ulium, you comment on my post, your whole network, everyone who follows you sees that you in my post. It's like a compounding effect that just follows. And as you can see, I mean, it did pretty well. Um, damn. That's so important to to point out how how the algorithm actually works on on LinkedIn. It's just like with YouTube, you understand that they they're incentivized to recommend videos that are going to lead to long watch times and long sessions. just and on LinkedIn anytime someone comments if you can try to bait someone into commenting like if you maybe made a post about me and then I happened to comment on it then boom it goes to my whole network right and so the the lead magnets like this and asking them for them to to comment is going to get all of that spread out into other people's networks right like the thing about LinkedIn that I found over time is that it doesn't so much matter about the algorithm itself it's more so that you just share value like the way that you share value is different right here is through a video showing hey guys I just built this here's what it does I've never worked with the business but here's what it does and here's just me giving away some stuff. Um, and that's playing the LinkedIn algorithm. And I'll break down the exact post and how they work, all that sort of stuff. So, we can go that into more detail. The third one is personal show that you're human. Again, this right here, I think, is so underrated. You saw Mer, he did some personal post that did really well. H is the fact that LinkedIn necessarily like two years ago, two three years ago, it was just seen as a hiring platform. I still I think I still think it is seen as a hiring platform. And with the fact that LinkedIn is seen as a as a very serious platform and everyone's so serious and so like I'm proud to announce um then people necessarily care about their personal stories and that's like the proud to announce and that's like the the main thing is like if everyone's so professional don't be professional be yourself just share about your story of course like to the limit but um personal always builds up this is what builds a brand like this this right here I think what helps build a brand of like you're not just working with zooming on to that that bottom Lux over performance start learning. Sick. That's like showing behind the scenes the grind. That's like so so powerful, man. And what I really love about that this whole strategy if you zoom out a bit is like these are different content formats uh to zoom out to all three of them. And this is something that you guys really need to regardless of what kind of content you're doing is finding these different formats. And if you look at this, it's freaking genius because you have the lead magnets which are helping you to get pushed out into the algorithm. That's the discovery. It's like on YouTube here, I'll make some videos that are intended to go broad and get me discovered by new people. Those lead magnets are going to get you shown to a lot of new people. Then when they come in, they might like like or follow or connect with you in some way. And then they'll see on your page, you've got all of these show your expertise videos. And while those might not go as crazy, they will see that, oh, this guy's actually had a consistent track record of posting things that he knows. So, not only did he put this out, but one, he's a real person and he's got these like this is someone I might want to work with because he's obviously um into some interesting things or he's working really hard and he's got the expertise. This is like I'd say why this has worked for you so well is because you've got that discovery mechanism and then the credibility and authority and then also that human element to it. So, if you guys are doing content across any platform, the same thing applies. is need to find out how you're going to get pushed into the algorithm, how you're going to get discovered and then how you're going to show your expertise and then some element of of being a real person that people can actually relate to. So, I think you've freaking cracked it, mate. That's a it's textbook. But I mean the like we mentioned focusing on W platform. This is exactly why before I before I could put this together to show you guys it took me a year like a solid year which isn't a long time but like hours and hours and hours and hours just in my room just understanding what it is, how to do it, how to just get better and better and better. Invested money into like LinkedIn coaching and all that. Like all this stuff that I did to get really good at one platform and I'm still not good enough. To tell you enough like just being one platform is just so so key because like this is hard. Um imagine trying to do that across three at once. It's just there's just no way. Yeah. And that's why most people just stick to one platform and then they expand to different platforms when they understand one platform good enough. Um okay. So the automation videos lead magnets personal. The let's go on a deeper level. Let's look at the actual breakdown of the post itself. Each post on LinkedIn is similar. It has a hook. It has a body and CTA. Now CTA optional depending on the type of post that you make, but something that I always like to have because it drives them to take action. So the hook right here, one of the most important things about the post because fundamentally when you go on LinkedIn, most people don't know this, but 70% of the audience or people who are using LinkedIn are at work on their phones, right? So you want to make sure that the hook itself has 40 characters online, which is mobile optimized, summarizes the whole post. So when I look at this, I basically already want to understand exactly what the post is about without having to read it. And best to add numbers. So when you add numbers, it just shows results, more credibility, something that we're more willing to to do. uh especially for business owners because they have no time. They want to see exactly how it impacts them and how like the outcome the outcome that they can have for their own business by looking at this post. Then we have the body of the email. So this right here is just in this case a list uh works great. So step one is this, step two is this, three and four. And again, this is for automation videos. So hey, I build this automation. Here's what it does, right? In this case is what it does part. Um avoid paragraphs, make it easy for the reader. Again, I mean, you've probably seen posts on LinkedIn that are just like three paragraphs long. Nobody reads that. So, don't even like don't even try it for that. Um, and the and like you've got those little arrows put in there as well to like literally guide the eyes onto the next onto the next line. It's not just a bullet point. It's like actually an arrow pointing them to it. Um, so like guiding their eyes through each line. Now, the CTA, which is essentially what do we want the the person to do? A lot of people don't add this, which you're missing out on because a lot of people because of the LinkedIn algorithm, because like commenting is like a big part of LinkedIn and you want someone to drive action, to take action, do something. In this case, one just tell them, here's the next step you want to take. In this case, because I'm repurposing a YouTube content, you can say, hey, check out the link in the comments for the walkthrough. So, fundamentally, that's a strategy that I had for LinkedIn. Um, and I mean, right here, I broke down exactly how we can write each post, the different types of post and and so on. We'll leave the link down below just in case you want to take a look at it. Yeah, there's tons of good stuff here, guys. So, if you are wanting to do LinkedIn and really break down the strategy, Kell has really fully broken down how he's writing these posts. So, uh, for the sake of the people who aren't maybe going to go all in on LinkedIn, uh, I'll link that down below with those other links there, you guys can check this out. Super valuable. I mean, if there's anything you want to copy or or take inspiration from, then then it's just so I really appreciate you sharing this with the guys. Yeah, no worries. And honestly, like the the formats of the post are very templated in a sense. So, it's if you follow once, if you see it once, you won't see it. Uh, you will not forget it and you just copy it. So, uh, that's pretty much it for the content strategy. And then down below, I mean, that is the reason why I was booking two to six calls a day from LinkedIn organic with no nothing paid, which is pretty unheard of um to say from one LinkedIn account from one guy just in his bedroom just trying to make it. Um I think that two to six calls a day was was pretty good. And and that was all What was your what was your like conversion mechanism off that? Cuz obviously a lot of engagement. I hear a lot of people saying, \"Oh, I might have got a bit of traction or impressions, but I wasn't able to convert those into book calls or qualified calls.\" So were you like you're shooting them the link to the resource in the DMs and then you're starting a conversation from there or how much are you automating this as well? So the funny thing is I didn't send a single DM for months like a single DM. Um what I was doing is just putting the lead magnet and then updating the post later with the link um and then letting them know. Now, fundamentally, like yes, I was sending them the resource, but I wasn't pushing for a call because previously what I know what I did before was like I put the the lead magnet, for example, like the 3,000 comments. I was just on my phone replying to each one. I'll send it to you. I'll send it I'll send in the lead magnet. I never follow up because I didn't need to because I was getting already two to six calls a day just from like just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, it's a supply issue, not a demand issue. It was a the same thing. Same thing. I think anyone who gets their acquisition and particularly content working well under this like for us at Morningside, it's not never been a never been a demand issue. It's always been a supply like how many new clients can we actually take on cuz there's just so much especially when you're doing general dev. I mean I guess it's like a good problem to have but it's still like it was still pretty bad. Um cuz the conversion off of like the book calls is horrible. I mean we can get into it still process that I had was consultation 45 minutes then proposal call another 45 minutes and then I had a 5% close rate. Now that's not even noticeable. I mean that's horrible. Um but the the the close rate was honestly it's just a numbers game. I'm like out of a hundred people that I speak to, I think one of them is gonna say yes, you know, and and and in between the consultation and the proposal is like four hours of like prepping and proposal writing and prep like putting together the slide deck and getting ready to prop like present it to them, right? So, I remember we would spend like four to six hours like prepping. As the projects get bigger and bigger as well, there's like way more you need to cover and more more like working with the devs to figure out how long it's going to take. But yeah, give us the how do you get over this one, bro? I I love this part. On that note, man, I was using Canva like every day for like three, four hours just putting like like you said proposals together. This looks pretty. This looks nice. Um but over time you realize like you can cut it down. Um and you get on the call and and they just not you realize you haven't financially qualified them at all and then they like they see the price and they go oh like they get a shock and then you just never hear from them again. So Exactly. Yeah. So the problem here wasn't the amount of book calls that I got. It's just conversion. Like I I had no friction which means that I had I think two three questions on the on the actual form. they could book in at any time they wanted for how long they wanted. Uh, and they just just came right in, right? And I just had to book calls every single day. I was so stressed. I was it was just horrible. The process that I went through to actually solve this was through actually changing my my sales process. So, fundamentally, it's just adding more friction, which means that you now tell the client, we only have a 20-minute consultation, which is free, so they can book in. Um, and this is more than enough time, more than enough time to like figure out exactly like sort of like where they're at and so on. And then if they're qualified, not qualified, but if they're Yeah. qualified, I'll say, then you pitch an audit. Now, this is something that I got off of your video where you mentioned an exploratory um expiration milestone. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, that's that's the thing that I implemented. So, I told them, hey, if you want to work with me, you have to pay $200 for one hour for the audit. So, that actually made it worth my time to even hop on a call with a business owner. And that did three things. That increased my my ability to close because I spend more time with the business owner. that can actually like teach them some stuff and in in a sense and actually take them through different things see more opportunities for upsells later on because when you break down everything and audit you start to see more problems more problems so you can start start making like a road map as to like we can do this first and then that um and then the third thing is just you get more qualified people because if they're willing to pay for it they're they're going to be willing to pay for for whatever it is that you have now this is key guys I've I'll put the video that uh that is referencing here on on how we do exploration milestones at Morning Side. We'll link that down below as well. But it's really important. We had the same issues at Morningside. Terrible close rate despite tons and tons of leads. And as soon as you put a financial qualification in, either like it's a quick audit call or it's like we would hop off the end of our consults at Morningside and we'd say, \"Okay, yeah, we're ready to go on this.\" Basically, like there's a few there's always a few unknowns here. So, we're going to start at like 800 or or 1500 or now it's like $5 $10,000 for us what we charge for these initial engagements. But, we're going to explore these different solutions and we're going to see if it's actually technically feasible for you. And then at at the end of that, you get the full proposal and then we can move into the next next part of the the contract. What was it for you though? Um how did you know when to price the audit the the milestone that you that you did with them? When to or how to price it? How did you know how much how much to price them? Cuz you mentioned it's like three 10K. Like how did you Yeah, it's it's based off the size of the client and also the size of the project. So if it's like a huge one and we're talking about it's going to be like a 100 $200,000 project. We've just done a a uh expiration phase. We're in the middle of one just wrapping up at the moment. That's I think it was $10,000 or at least five figures um for the exploration part alone. And that started as as like a $500 like it, let's see if they say yes and then it went up to $800 then,000 and like we just gradually increased it um as the size of our clients grew as well. So you can just start super low like you do with this this audit just anything to financially qualify them to get the tire kickers out. Now they improve I say improved because I my closure went to 40%. Which is much better like an 8x from the 5% that I had. I was so much less stressed. I was making more because the quality of clients was increasing and I was working with less clients, less calls and more time uh to do whatever I want. Um, all right. So, that right there fundamentally is how the LinkedIn strategy was and that's what I used to get more people to know about my stuff. The next milestone or phrase that I had to go through was productizing my offer. Now, the reason why I wanted to productize my offer, it was by choice because with make.com for automations, because of the reason why it's custom, you get a lot of problems that I had to go through. The first one is scope creep. So, every single client that you that you get into doing a project, what it looks like at the start and what it actually looks like at the end, it's completely different. Completely different. So, uh it was it was it wasn't that nice when you had to figure when you figured out that something couldn't be done the way that you thought it was or when the client told you, hey, we actually have this step and you're like, oh, that changes everything. And then you got to like be a bit of an ass. You feel like you've been an  about it. You're like, no, but like that's that's not what we agreed on, man. Like, we're going to I'm going to need to charge you more for that. Um, and that's some uncomfortable discussions that I think early agency owners maybe aren't super great at dealing with, but just like knowing your value and saying, \"No, this is this is what we agreed on.\" Um, so yeah, I mean it's just about understanding that you're helping them like they're not help like they're not helping you at the sense, you know? So like position yourself is like I mean I'm making you a favor. So like let's let's just work together to make sure that we can we can get this going uh and whatever extra work we need. The the only thing for me at the start was like I told them let's say we're doing an onboarding system. The outcome is we'll do a fully onboarding a fully automated onboarding system but that that's the outcome you sign on the contract but the onboarding system changed over time but the outcome was still I had to do the onboarding system so I still have to do the project yes or yes and that wasn't that was a non-negotiable for us uh and you can talk to the client and so on but um at the start it was it wasn't something that I that I had the the balls to just go to the client and just say all right so when it came to productizing my offer um apart from scope creep we also had the knowledge gap so knowledge gap just means that whenever a new client came through they're from a different niche I had to relearn the whole market to un to contextualize the automation to like their business. And so that came from from just not knowing any niche and just figuring out as I go. But productizing my offer, the first part of it was just niching down. And so what I did is I analyzed the past 10 months of clients and I asked myself who did I like to work with, what brought the most money and what recurring problem that I get asked to solve the most. And that's like the that's the fundamental thing of like, okay, I need to niche down. And I analyzed all my calls, all the clients that I worked with, all that sort of stuff to then niche down to uh to the offer that I'm that I'm running now, which is again working with agencies um in specific for the client delivery, which is very niche. That's so far, man. I I think if you've like nailed it with that, that's such like a for the people that you're trying to help, that's like exactly what they they want to hear. Double client capacity without hiring more people in 30 days. It's so specific. Uh that's that's just such a fire positioning statement. So niche. So niche. this is like this super niche that um I mean there's there's not a lot of people who do this but fundamentally it's like when you niche down you're just scared that you're just missing out on opportunities but for me it's like I couldn't I couldn't do the custom work anymore so I had to do more so something that was repeatable so you can do every single time but also I knew the niche really well um and I could solve the actual problem that they had and by the way if you guys want to take a look at the the LinkedIn profile that I had when I actually had the offer this is what it looked like outcome picture statement and then the about section as well awesome yeah I mean that's typical way I laid it out. And so for me, the important thing was prioritizing my offer to make things repeatable. Um, so the delivery itself had to be repeatable because it was solving one painoint for one niche. And so the delivery process that we had was using a framework that I made over time which is called the AIAT framework. It all started with the audit. So fundamentally what this is is a call with me and the founder just breaking down the process that they went through from the moment a client signs to the moment a client to deliver the service and the whole process they had to go through that. Now this process was crucial again because without this we can't go to the next step. Um so fundamentally we just break down their whole thing is it's about one to two hour calls that we do with the with the clients and uh yeah this is an example that we had. Then we have the implementation phase and this is where we centralize their project management system on notion and these are the dashboards that um where they basically manage their whole client delivery. So team tasks um projects all that sort of stuff there. Okay. And so this is you migrating them over to something that you've built right. So this is a template that you've created and you're like this is my system. this is how you're going to be able to scale your uh like increased number of clients you can you can handle without hiring more people. So you're sort of pushing them onto this because I know the niche really well and I know that agencies to manage their client delivery they use one software and other software and three other softwares and everything's so scattered. So notion is a software we use because it allows us to put everything in one place. So yeah that's references everything here. So implement project management and then we go to the automation part which is where we automated at least 30% of the whole client delivery using make.com. So see how I'm not discarding make.com. I'm just putting it into like a higher ticket more um just more transformation for the agency. That's increasing and integrating with like a bigger system in this case. Mhm. And so you you're just changing these around maybe like 20% of the work done that you would have had to do initially is just like tweaking it around, changing the prompts, making sure it's all working as as expected. 100%. I mean cuz I knew the niche really well and they all had similar problems. They they all had a similar process. Um, so it wasn't it wasn't like a crazy amount of difference from each each sort of agency. And the next part is train. So we obviously had a delivery call with the team. We made SOPs uh that we can put them in notion. So we they know exactly how the the whole system works. And then we have the optimized period which is 60 days. So we improve the system over time. We jump up bi-weekly calls with the whole team and make sure that any changes are made after using the system. Now, this is great for us because we get to cultivate the relationship with the client, which is, I believe, is one of the most important things as you're getting into higher ticket because this right here, this offer was going for 9.5K. Um Mhm. And so, 9.5K. Yeah. Damn, bro. That's bro, that's way more than I than I would have expected. That's freaking awesome. Just positioning, bro. Uh positioning, bro. And and it's also like if you got enough leads, you can afford to be, you know, like the more demand you have uh on these calls, like if you have only 10 people coming to you, you might have to sell it for five because like the chance of you having people who are are willing to pay that much is is is a lot less. But you have 100 people, there's going to be a handful of those who do have the budgets and are willing to spend more on this AI stuff than than the others. You can kind of volume your way into high ticket. Um which is basically what we've done at Morningside as well. I mean just just to let you know like the I ran an offer campaign on LinkedIn to get these clients. I sent about 580 loons personalized loons to people and to get my to get one one client which is 10k but like the in the upside is like so much better because it's 10k instead of just 2k which is like a normal project. Um so you ideally you want to work with less clients who pay more and increase ever made. So that's that. All right, let me go to the last milestone or the last process that I had to go through, which is how to outsource. So, how to make sure that now you have all these clients, you have these projects. How can you give it to someone else so you can focus on actually growing the business, making content because it is a full-time job like James said. So, the strategy for me was using three different places. The first one was the uh AAA um school community. So, I just put a post here, which is a full circle moment cuz I used to look for jobs here and now I'm putting a job there for someone to to talk out to me. That's the ecosystem, man. Like, it it works. And I'm on my YouTube videos telling business owners like go into my school community and post for you like make posts saying you're looking for certain things. Like you can come in here to to make posts about hiring as well. And then other people can come in here looking for work. Like it's a perfect perfect meeting of the two sides of this space right now. 100%. And uh the second thing for me was making a post on LinkedIn asking if anyone's interested now because right because I was doing notion as well like it was more it wasn't something that I could ideally find here. I mean, I posted here. I didn't get anything great off of Notion, but workflow automations because it's the AI automation space, I got like tons of people. So, that was that was good for me. So, LinkedIn as well. And then the accelerator, I mean, you guys have a whole literally a whole like place to to find people and they're they're vetted. Like, you won't put them there if they're not good. So, I used as well. All right. And when outsourcing to other people, the problems that you're going to find when you're when you're giving work to someone else, at least that I find um is you don't have enough cash flow to hire someone full-time. So, you hire a freelancer. The problem is is that freelancers are cheap but and they're lower quality, right? So that means you have to spend more time on training and resources. And what I found at least the freelancers that I worked for, they weren't not delivering on the timelines that I set. But it's like the the balance is like you will only pay more for someone who's more skilled but you don't have the cash flow um compared to someone who is cheaper, but you have to put more time into like making sure that you do the right job. Yeah, I've been I've been ringing this bell for for a long time. We had those that was our first when I was getting Morning Side AI off the ground. It was it was Upwork freelancers initially and they just you're one of you're one of 10 clients and I mean they're probably not even like they might just be good at reaching out out to people within the community and they've got a lot of projects but they're not super skilled. Um and so you want to be able to get to that point where you can pay someone to get all of their time and that's such a big unlock for any any agency or anything you're doing here in the AI space is that first full-time developer because they can drive so much uh in results and deliveries for you. So um it is it is a tricky period initially with these with the freelancers. I mean the good thing about my offer was that it wasn't so custom so like I could train someone to do it. Um and the the thing that really ended up happening was that I just got a notion guy who just did not stuff cuz that was like the main thing structuring the system and I offloaded the the make.com to someone else as well. So I had these two people in the same time. Now the solutions that I can that you can implement that I implemented was set expectations on day one make them want to work with you. I think that's one of the the main things is like I mean people if you have someone who's good who's I mean if you have someone who you can see potential that they're actually good make them want to work with you like invest time into making sure that they're all set uh to make sure that you stay and you basically form a long-term relationship because working with someone I mean you your business is your baby like you want to make sure that it actually grows and you want to make sure that the people who are taking care of the business are are just they're solid and they have a they see your vision. Yeah. Super in invested in what you're doing. Yeah. And that's uh that's part of that when the leadership skills come into play is like painting the vision. I mean like look we're going places like this is do you want to be on the ship like look I want to get you into these roles like you can really step up into this position. Um and the right people will respond really well to that. And uh that's that's how I've always approached leading these people. And right here I mean we walk through the whole five-step process that uh that I went through to get to 100K with the with the agency. And fundamentally along the way you just get to learn new skills for here is just automations. Then here is how to reach out to people for the first time. Then here is content, which is a massive one. Here's offers, um, leads, all that sort of stuff you want to know. And then here's how to outsource, which is fundamentally all the skills you need to learn, um, you're going to have to learn to to get point. Yeah. I mean, it's it's the the the business 101 skill set, right? Like how to get clients, how to, uh, run the operations of the business, how to hire people and manage them, um, how to learn skills that you're going to eventually be able to monetize as well. So, mate, that's been uh some mega mega source. If you guys can't uh haven't got anything out of that, then there's something wrong with you. As someone who's on calls regularly with people, I'm talking to hundreds and hundreds of people across the community. I see it firsthand in my communities as well.

          "transcript": "Ever worry you'll be the next one let go during company layoffs? AI is changing the rules if you pick the right skills. So in this video I'm going to show you seven high-paying AI skills that employers desperately need and exactly how you can master them in just 30 days to make yourself irreplaceable. Almost no background required. Almost half a million tech workers lost their jobs since 2023. And many of them were highly skilled and still got replaced. Some of them were my friends. They still are. And watching them lose work despite their talent hit me hard. But a few they pivoted. They picked up AI leveraged skills and they're now making more than they did in big tech. So over the past year, I've been obsessing over one question. What are the skills that make you irreplaceable in an AI world? And I dug through dozens of industry reports, research papers, case studies, and I believe everything points to these seven. And the last one, it's the skill that nobody talks about, but once you have it, clients never stop coming back. I believe we live in an age of speed and outcomes, not degrees and certainly not 10-year plans. But most people fall into the trap of skill chasing. They jump from tool to tool, course to course, stacking half-learned skills and feeling productive while never actually monetizing anything. And I know it feels good, but it's just a dopamine trap. Or even worse, an excuse to never move forward and choose to be paralyzed by fear of imperfection. The truth is that being great at one high value skill beats being average at seven. Companies will not hire generalists who know a little bit of everything anymore. They hire the person who owns a lane and can deliver the result. And I believe that's what makes you irreplaceable. And here's where a lot of people, especially solopreneurs, get stuck. They think they need to do it all themselves. But that's not leverage. That's ego. My husband and I work together so well because we have complimentary skills. I don't try to do everything or be everything and neither does he. We rely on each other and that's what allows us to move fast to ship results and to actually serve the need while it's at its peak. Because I believe the reality is that if you spend four years mastering seven different skills or more, by the time you're ready to sell, the environment will have already shifted. Opportunities nowadays are quite perishable. The people who win are the ones who pick one high-paying skill. they go deep fast and monetize it while demand is still at its highest. So don't think of these seven skills as a shopping list. You don't have to check everything off. Think of them as a compass. Your job is to choose one, go deep, and then build or partner for the rest. That is how you become irreplaceable. So the first lane is what I call the visionary strategist. And I understand it might sound abstract. So let me explain. The brutal truth is that most companies are experimenting with AI, but 85% of AI projects fail. Why? Well, not because the models are bad and certainly not because the tools don't work. It's often times because there is no clear strategy. Companies just chase shiny tools, you know, but no one is asking the bigger questions. Where does AI make us money? Where does it save time? Where could it blow up? And that gap that gets filled by the visionary strategist. This is an AI business strategist. If you think about it, it's consulting and decision architecture. It's the person who designs how AI fits into business decisions. It's basically like being the architect who draws the blueprint before the builders arrive. And before you jump to conclusions, no, you are not just recommending tools. That is not the point. You are designing the entire decision architecture, which processes to automate, what metrics to track, and how to manage the ethical, the financial and the operational risks within that particular business. And I think I read in Harvard Business Review that this is the most critical gap in corporate AI adoption. So there's clearly a need for it. And if you're thinking, but can't AI just do it itself? Well, what you might not know is that only about 30% of consulting tasks can even be automated in the next decade according to McKenzie. The rest requires human judgment, context, and a lot of trust. And I mean whether we agree with the exact number or not, that's not the point of this video. But I do know that AI cannot fully replace this. Now let me give you an example because I think that always paints the picture better. BCG worked with IBM on a comprehensive AI transformation strategy and instead of random pilots uh what they did was they built a systematic roadmap focusing on support functions on legal IT and procurement and I think HR as well and as a result IBM unlocked $3.5 billion in cost savings and 50% increase in productivity over two years. I mean that's a huge impact even for a company that size and companies are paying for this clarity right now on LinkedIn or even on Upwork if you look you will see businesses hiring AI strategy consultants and you will find them offering $70 $100 sometimes even $200 an hour and retainers for this type of work go to thousands of dollars and if you're looking at full strategy projects of course it depends on the size of the business you're serving but this would make you look at several thousand and if you want to be an employee glass shows that this is a role that gets paid between $107 to $174,000 per year. I mean, think about that. People aren't paying for prompts or for tools. They're paying for confidence. They're paying for someone who can sit in the room and say, \"Here's how AI fits in your business. Here's how to make it safe, and here's how to get results with it.\" That's the visionary strategist. You provide an AI adoption roadmap. You provide ROI models, readiness assessments, governance, risk, compliance guidance, and so on and so forth. Basically, consulting but for AI. So, how do you become the visionary strategist in 30 days? You don't need a PhD. Let me start there. You need a very good framework, a clear offer, some business acumen helps if you have it, and probably most importantly, the courage to get started. Okay, so let me break it down. In terms of the 30-day sprint, I believe what you can do in week one is to read all the industry reports that you can get through, but not with AI. actually read them whether it's McKenzie or HBR or Deoid I don't care and then go ahead and summarize the insights into an AI value thesis could be one pager and there you can use AI I'll give you that and then in week two you can learn about ROI and risk models at its core you're helping a company answer this main question if we invest this much money into AI how much time or money do we save or how much new revenue do we generate and what hidden costs should we be mindful of as well so what you can do is build your models and draft a few slide AI adoption roadmap. This might seem complex, but if you do have any business or finance background, I'm sure you can do it. It It's actually not that hard. And then week three, you can run two to three mock audits either on your friend's businesses or anybody else who would be willing to be a guinea pig for you. And what you want is to identify and document time or cost savings or new opportunities. And then in week four, you can launch your offer. You can call it the AI readiness audit for a fixed fee and then you can follow with a fullyfledged road map where you can charge a lot more. But look, strategy without execution is just paper. I know back in my consulting days, we used to say that our clients many times get a report and then they drop it into a drawer and forget about it. So with that in mind, once you design the road map, companies are probably going to ask, okay, now how do we adopt it? So that's what lane 2 can offer. That's the design thinker, the one who actually turns the road map into an automated or more automated workflows. And if you want speed, this is where the real money shows up in my opinion. So, if you're excited about all of this opportunity, but you're also realizing that there's a lot more out there than just stitching tools together or being at surface level, then I genuinely recommend taking a look at the applied generative AI specialization program delivered by SimplyLearn in partnership with Purdue University online. It is one of probably the most comprehensive and practical ways to master agentic AI rag systems LLM powered applications. It is a 16 weeks program and you're learning curriculum that has been reviewed and approved by instructors and advisers with decades of experience in enterprise AI and software engineering. It includes over 70 hours of hands-on training across tools like Langchain, OpenAI, Deli, Hugging Face, and Copilot. So, if you're serious about mastering this new wave of AI, not just for fun, but for serious business AI applications, then this is, in my opinion, a high leverage move. You can go ahead and apply now via the link down in the description, as well as the QR code here on the screen. Cohorts are limited and admission closes soon. So, go ahead and check out the next admissions deadline, and make sure you sign up before that. And if you're building your career for the long game, this might just be your launchpad. Also, thank you Simply Learn for partnering with us on today's video. So, let's get into the second lane, the design thinker. This is the workflow optimizer. The person who redesigns processes so humans can focus on decisions while AI and agents can handle the repetitive work. And this is not about um duct taping tools together. You will be rearchitecting how a business runs. It's like redesigning a kitchen so the chef can spend less time walking and more time cooking. Okay? And this is extremely valuable because most companies don't actually have broken technology. What they have is broken processes. And both McKenzie and Deote found that the majority of productivity gains don't come from adding new tools but from rethinking the workflow itself. And here's something that you might not realize. Those improvements require human insight into culture into the organization because AI cannot map a messy process or navigate team politics. Only a human design thinker can do that. And the demand is exploding. I mean look on any job board and you will see AI workflow designer, AI automation architect. All of these are popping up everywhere and companies are paying top dollar for process redesign projects and sometimes four or even five figures per month for ongoing optimization retainers. And we're going to make sure to include some examples from Upwork postings so you can see that what I'm saying is actually true. I am not making up these numbers. And if you're wondering, okay, but what does this exactly do? Let me give you an example quickly. We've seen, for example, a marketing agency that had people manually handling customer onboarding, taking up to three hours per client. And then a design thinker came in and mapped the process and automated 60% of the repetitive steps. I think it was with Zapier, Make and AI integration. The result was that the onboarding and proposal creation time dropped from 3 hours to 1 hour and it cut manual work by 70%. I mean, that is the power of the design thinker. You make businesses faster, leaner, and more scalable. And if you're thinking, okay, I get the point, but what would a client actually expect from me? What they would expect is that you can analyze their current state and map that and then design the future state and provide agent specifications and automation opportunities and KPIs so that they know how to measure success. And if you put your mind to it, you can become a design thinker in 30 days. It's not easy, but I mean, a lot of great things in life require effort, right? So, what's the 30-day sprint? In the first week, what I would do would be to learn the basics of business process management. That's BPM and design thinking. There's loads of resources online. But what you want to make sure is that you understand how to break a process into clear steps and spot the bottlenecks. And then on week two, I would learn what today's automation tools and AI agents can actually do and get familiar with the possibilities as well as the limitations. And then on week three, I would take two to three real processes. It could be onboarding, invoicing, customer support, and then redesign them using what I would have learned and show the before and the improved after. And then week four, I would package that redesigned process as a process audit as well as an agent roadmap. And then I would include the current workflow, the optimized version, and the expected savings. And I would go and pitch that to a lot of businesses. And look, the thing is that once workflows are optimized, companies want more than efficiency. They want to actually implement it. Okay, so that is lane three that you could also consider. And I'm calling this one the architect. Okay, this is the AI stack design and integration specialist. You've got a working prototype, maybe even a successful pilot. But here's the harsh reality. 42% of companies abandoned most of their AI initiatives in 2025, up from just 17% in 2024. I mean, that is a huge change. And according to Rand Corporation research, over 80% of AI projects fail. twice the failure rate of nonAI technology projects. I mean that's quite astounding. And if you're wondering why, well, it's because prototypes don't scale. When you try to push them to hundreds or thousands of users, they break. That is where this role, this type of skill becomes irreplaceable. Okay. The architect, which is, as I said, the AI stack engineer is the one who builds systems that actually work sometimes at enterprise scale even if it's not designed for an enterprise user. The architect's role is to design the backbone, the data architecture, the API integrations, the security frameworks, the deployment infrastructure. So if you decide to pursue this, you'll be the one who takes the proof of concept and turn it into a production grade system that can handle real world traffic, data volumes, business requirements, and so on. And if you're thinking, oh, that sounds great, but can't AI do that? How is this irreplaceable? Well, because AI is not plug-and-play at scale. The Rand Corporation study identified inadequate infrastructure as one of the five leading causes of AI project failure. And many times companies cited cost overruns, data privacy concerns, the security risks as the primary obstacles according to the S&P global market intelligences 2025 survey of over a thousand enterprises. But look, when done right, the returns are massive. So, I think I read about this company called Lumen Technologies that projected $50 million in annual savings from AI tools that save their sales team four hours per week. And Air India's AI virtual assistant handles now 97% of 4 million over 4 million customer queries with full automation. I mean clearly there is a use case for this type of skill and the market reflects this value. Enterprise AI architecture projects typically range from a 100,000 to half a million in mid-market companies. But you don't have to think about that kind of size. Okay. Ongoing infrastructure management and optimization retainers run for several thousand per month according to this article in Medium. Why? Because the cost of failure is enormous for any size company, especially for the medium and larger ones. companies are literally abandoning millions in AI investments due to poor architecture. Now, of course, these are projects delivered by entire teams, not a solo engineer. But this shows, I think, the huge potential. And not only that, but there are, for example, loads of jobs looking for this exact skill set on Upwork. Okay, so here's a quick example of how a project for this type of skill could look like. An e-commerce brand wanted to deploy an AI recommendation engine and their prototype worked in tests but crashed under live traffic and then architect an engineer came in rebuilt the data pipeline deployed it on a scalable cloud stack and added monitoring and within weeks the system not only was stable but the company's revenue per customer jumped by 18%. I mean that is the leverage that the architect you can bring. You don't just make AI work, you make it bulletproof at scale. So if you're thinking of pursuing something like this, you need to feel comfortable providing your client with system architecture design and cloud infrastructure setup. Whether that's Azure or AWS or Google Cloud, you need to be comfortable with API gateway configurations, with data pipeline engineering, with security implementation, with monitoring, with observability, with performance optimization, disaster recovery planning. I know that sounds complex. So, if you're new to this and you're wondering, can I actually learn this in 30 days? Well, if you have some technical background, you can. If you don't and you're completely new to infrastructure, it will take you longer. I'm not going to lie, but you can start with smaller projects and then build from there. So, how would I uh look at the 30-day plan? Week number one, I would look at foundations. I would learn AI infrastructure basics like data, compute, models, APIs, security, and then I would get hands-on with cloud, whether it's Docker, Azure, and then deploy a simple AI API wrapper. Now week number two, I would start looking into integration and data. So I would build pipelines and APIs. I would master ETL and streaming and GraphQL and I would add AI specific security and then I would deliver a unified secure API that connects multiple services. If this sounds like a different language, probably it gives you a little bit of context on where you need to start. If it doesn't, then let's move to week number three. And then what I would do, I would look into monitoring and scaling. So I would set up observability. I would optimize performance with some caching with CDNs. I would design disaster recovery. I think that's super important. And I would look into scaling strategies and I'd stress test. And then week number four, I would look into real world and business use cases. I'd develop case studies or model costs or ROI. And then I'd look at how I could package my offer or I would start looking for jobs where I could apply. And as I said, if this feels a bit too complex for your level of comfort, this next one is just as impactful and a lot easier to learn. Okay, so let's move to lane number four. Businesses want to automatically engage with their customers and prospects. But here's the reality. Most companies are stuck between expensive custom development and generic, frustrating chat bots that drive customers away. And that is why I believe this next skill is so critical. I'm calling this one the AI conversation designer. Okay, so this is the AI agent developer who builds intelligent conversational systems that actually work. And the skill is not just about conversation design or mocking up UIs. You are basically the one that actually builds the chat bots, the voice agents, the AI powered customer service systems. I mean, think Vappy integrations or custom GPT implementations or multi- channelannel conversational AI or intelligent routing systems that can handle complex customer interactions. And if you're thinking, okay, but why is this role that irreplaceable? Well, I think it's because while AI models can generate responses, they can't architect themselves into functional business systems. Somebody actually needs to connect the APIs and design the conversation flows and integrate with CRM and provide knowledge bases and guard rails and handle edge cases and make sure the whole system scales reliably. That is technical work that requires, in my opinion, human expertise. But the reality looks different. Gartner found that chatbot failures are often based on design problems, not technical ones. And in one Ipso study, 73% of customers reported abandoning a transaction following a poor chatbot experience. I mean, the impact for businesses is huge. And that gap is a human problem, not a tech problem. In fact, studies have shown that well-implemented conversational AI can in fact reduce customer service costs by up to 50%. I think 30 to 50% while improving satisfaction scores. I mean, that's massive, right? And according to Medium, businesses using chat bots in the right way can increase annual revenue by seven all the way to 25%. And clearly companies are desperately trying to automate customer interactions, but most lack the technical expertise to build anything beyond basic FAQ bots. The market is paying premium rates for this kind of expertise. I mean right now businesses are willing to pay from a couple thousand to five sometimes even six figures per implementation project depending obviously on the complexity on the industry on the size of the business and ultimately the business impact. And then there are monthly retainers for maintenance, for optimization, which can run from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars, according to Parramatic. Because a properly built conversational AI system can handle thousands of interactions 24/7, replacing entire customer service teams. I mean, even Upwork has tons of job postings looking for this exact skill set. Okay, so let me give you an example so we are clear on what I mean. There was a fintech startup that replaced their generic bot with a carefully designed one and mapped user intents and added empathy statement and built smart escalation triggers. And within 3 months, customer satisfaction scores jumped 40% and conversion rates on upselles also went up. That must have been worth millions in revenue, all from better conversation design. So if this sounds exciting, what you might want to be prepared to offer your clients would be custom bot development, API integration, for example, Vappy or OpenAI or Twilio and then multi- channelannel deployment like web or phone or SMS or WhatsApp or Telegram or Slack analytics dashboards and ongoing optimization. And the beauty of this skill is that every business needs customer interaction automation, but most of them don't have technical expertise to build it themselves. So, you become their go-to expert for turning customer service from a cost center into a competitive advantage. So, if this sounds exciting, what I would do for the next 30 days would be kind of like this. Week number one, I would master the core platforms. I would learn chat GPT APIs, Bappy for voice agent, and at least one chatbot framework, whether that's bot press or voice flow or something else. And then I would build three basic prototypes. Then in week two, I would learn integration skills. I would learn how to connect bots to calendars or to CRM or to HubSpot or payment systems like Stripe or to communication channels like I said WhatsApp Business or Twilio. And then I would build two integrated demos. And then week three, I would focus on advanced features like sentiment analysis and intelligent routing and escalation triggers and analytics. And I'd create a comprehensive case study with before and after metrics if you are able to access somebody who's willing to be a guinea pig. And then week four, I would package that service, whether it's a complete AI voice and chat agent implementation or something else. And then I would go and pitch it to five or 10 businesses that currently have high customer service uh costs. And if development is not for you, but you enjoy being involved in the tech space, this next one would be a perfect one to consider. Okay, so let's move to the fifth lane because so far we've talked about strategy, we've talked about workflows, about conversations, lots of development, but not everyone is a fan of coding or tech development. So if you see potential and you don't want to miss it, but you're not that technical yet, this will be perfect for you. This is the prototype thinker. This is a job that might sound simple, but it's massively powerful. This is the type of skill set that helps you turn vague business goals into working AI prototypes. You're basically the bridge between decision makers and developers, between what the business wants and what AI can actually do. And I think this is massively irreplaceable because AI can generate a lot of outputs with the right guidance, but it cannot talk to stakeholders. It cannot run interviews. It cannot prioritize features. It cannot define success metrics. I mean, it can, but it'll be hard to actually follow up on them. And LinkedIn data shows that AI product management roles are exploding right now. And it's not a surprise. is I mean with so many companies coming out with their own AI tool or personalized app or other AI products this is something that you would expect right and if you look closely you will see that the market is actually rewarding this product managers with AI skills are charging anywhere from $60 to $100 an hour and sometimes are offered even retainers for the right fit. I mean, we will show you a bunch of Upwork postings that are proving exactly that. And I think the value of the prototype thinker is that you do the mental model translation from business to engineering and you scout for use cases and you make ideas real, tangible, and you do that fast. And if you think, okay, this sounds great. I think I'm a good fit and I would like to pursue this. What should I go and learn? Well, week number one, I would study product frameworks like jobs to be done and design thinking. And then I will collect 10 real AI use cases. And then in week number two, I would prototype two ideas using no code AI tools like I don't know, Replet or Rocket or Bubble or Lovable or whatever you choose. And then I would run five user tests to validate assumptions and document results in week three. And in week four, I would offer that as a service or I would look to get hired full-time or part-time on AI projects because there is so much demand for something like this right now. Okay, now let's move to the next lane because here's the thing. Maybe you're somebody who is massively creative and you don't want to lose touch with that talent and you still want to get into tech a little bit but not too deep. Well, this skill I'm calling the genai creator. This is somebody who sets the creative direction and then uses AI as leverage to multiply ideas not to replace them. So imagine being the person who can design an entire brand campaign, messaging, visuals, videos in days instead of months because AI is your creative team. So if you're thinking, \"Yeah, but anybody can use midjourney. What makes this irreplaceable?\" Well, it's because AI can generate content, but it cannot decide what great looks like. It cannot know what will convert. It cannot know why it will convert or why it will inspire the most emotion. It has no taste, no intuition for story, no sense for brand. And I think Adobe found that AI tools boosted creative productivity by 40%. But companies still need human directors to set the tone, to define the narrative and to decide what to ship. So without a Genai creator, AI content will just look like generic noise, you know. And businesses are paying for this. Trust me, right now brands are hiring AI savvy creative directors because every company's drowning in content, but they're starving for direction. So, I'm going to make sure to include here some Upwork examples so you can see that even smaller companies are looking to hire for something like this. So, here's an example to bring this home and and hopefully make it clearer for you. A consumer brand partnered with a JI creator who used MidJourney for imagery, Chad GPT for copy, and a few AI video tools for a storyboard campaign. In less than a month, they shipped what used to take a full agency at least 3 months and cut costs by 60%. The brand called it their most efficient campaign ever. I mean, that is exactly what you are able to do if you're creative and you know how to use AI. That's the leverage of this type of role. You don't replace creativity with AI. You amplify it. Okay? So, if you're creative and you'd like to pursue this, here's what I'd do for the next 30 days. I would first of all make sure that I'm able to provide campaign strategy, brand voice libraries, multimodal content, performance analysis. So, how do you do that? In week number one, I would go ahead and learn prompt design across mediums for text, for images, for video. Maybe I'd start with chat, GPT, and midjourney, but there's a lot of great tools out there. Week number two, I would build a brand voice operating system uh template to help me lock in tone and style for my clients. And then obviously I would play with that and test it enough to make sure that it does a great job. And then week number three, I would produce a mini campaign, emails, socials, I don't know, landing pages entirely with AI tools guided by my or your direction. And then I would look to package that in week three and go and pitch it to five to 10 clients. But here's the thing, even the best stack in the world won't save you if no one cares. So lane number seven, I'm calling it the connector. This is somebody who builds the community around a product. so that it can actually grow. Because even the best AI strategy, the cleanest workflows, the smartest bots, the most creative campaigns, and the sharpest products, all of it collapses if nobody cares. So, pretty much any brand needs lane 7, the connector, the community architect. And the role of this type of person or this type of skill set is to design the human layer around their products and businesses. You don't just build technology, you build trust, belonging, and momentum. Because I think the truth is that people don't want tools, you know, they want to feel part of something. They they want to feel like they belong to a community. So what makes this irreplaceable? I mean clearly AI cannot replace community. Okay? Community cannot be automated. In fact, a recent study that I came across showed that 68% of people can spot AI generated engagement. And if customers feel that they're just talking to bots, they will at some point disengage. So if you look closely, what they want is a space to connect with other humans guided by someone who knows how to architect that experience. And the money is there, right? Don't get me wrong. Brands are paying top dollar for community launches. And then they're paying upwards of a thousand, sometimes more per month for ongoing community management and events. And I'm going to make sure to include some Upwork job postings here to show you that there is demand for school uh community managers, for other type of community managers because I mean communities drive retention. They drive referrals. They drive long-term brand equity in a way that ads I believe never will. So let me give you an example to bring this home. There was a software company that launched a new AI tool, but their marketing didn't perform as expected. And then a community architect stepped in, built a private Slack group and created a weekly expert Q&A and ran two virtual events in the first 60 days. And within three months, churn dropped by 25% and referrals spiked. I mean, the community became their growth engine after that. So, you can see the huge impact that an engaged honest human community can have on a business. That is the power of the connector. You build an ecosystem that makes everything else stick. So, if this sounds exciting, what you would need to be able to provide your clients with would be strategy, platform setup, whether it's Slack or Circle or School or Discord, an engagement calendar, moderation, analytics, events, and I think it's not necessarily hard to get started with this in 30 days. So, for example, in week one, you could look into all the free resources that exist here on YouTube, in school, even courses to understand more about communities and running communities. In week two, you can audit three thriving online communities and then document what works. And then week three, you could look into building, I don't know, six to eight weeks engagement calendar for your favorite community. And if you can present that to them and then week four, offer a community launch in 30 days package for your favorite influencers who don't have a community. All right, so this completes our map, the seven lanes. But remember, the point isn't to master all of them. That's ego, okay? So don't do that. It will just slow you down. The point is to pick one, master it and monetize it fast while demand is high and then you can partner with people in the other lane so that you can move faster together. That is how you become truly irreplaceable. Now if you want to figure out which one is best for you, we have actually created a very simple quiz completely free that you can come and take in the school community. I hope we remember to put the QR code here. And then we've also put together a free ebook that will show you for each one of these seven lanes the exact step-by-step 30-day learning program including links to some of the courses that we have taken or we have good uh references for and that you can go and take. Not all the courses are free just to be very clear. Some are, many are not or some are not. But I think it'll at least give you a great indication of how to spend those next 30 days in order to make sure that you maximize your impact and you're able to get out there as fast as possible. All right, you guys, that was it for today. Thank you so so much for watching. I really hope this was useful. I really hope that it gave you some ideas about what you can do next to make yourself irreplaceable. Like this video if you did. Be sure to subscribe if you haven't done so. Come and join us in the community. As I said, it's completely free. You will learn so much. We have challenges every two weeks. We have hype calls. So, our community calls every two weeks. We have a lot of fun. So, come and join us. It's completely free and you will get a lot of value out of it. And until next time, I suggest you go ahead and watch this video over here and I'll see you soon. Bye.",

So in this video I'm going to show you seven high-paying AI skills that employers desperately need and exactly how you can master them in just 30 days to make yourself irreplaceable. Almost no background required. Almost half a million tech workers lost their jobs since 2023. And many of them were highly skilled and still got replaced. Some of them were my friends. They still are. And watching them lose work despite their talent hit me hard. But a few they pivoted. They picked up AI leveraged skills and they're now making more than they did in big tech. So over the past year, I've been obsessing over one question. What are the skills that make you irreplaceable in an AI world? And I dug through",

          "transcript": "Nesse v√≠deo aqui, eu vou te falar o por que voc√™ n√£o deveria focar em aprender automa√ß√µes, ou melhor, em aprender automa√ß√µes, n√£o, em ser um automatizador em 2026. Talvez eu te fale algumas verdades duras, mas √© importante que voc√™ ou√ßa isso com aten√ß√£o, entenda e tome suas pr√≥prias decis√µes com rela√ß√£o aos fatos que eu vou trazer aqui para voc√™. Ah, vamos l√°. Primeira coisa que eu j√° quero pontuar, eu tenho total propriedade para falar isso que eu vou falar para voc√™s. Eu sou da √°rea de tecnologia desde que eu me conhe√ßo por gente. Comecei a desenvolver aos meus 16 anos, montei uma empresa de tecnologia, uma das principais insurtechs do Brasil. Eu vendi essa empresa, eu tive uma carreira tamb√©m como desenvolvedor, programador, fui evoluindo, virei arquiteto de software. Eh, eu adoro programar. At√© hoje eu s√≥ deixei de programar porque eu decidi focar realmente naquilo que d√° dinheiro, que √© neg√≥cio, t√°? Ent√£o eu tenho bastante propriedade para falar isso para voc√™s. Hoje eu tenho uma empresa de tecnologia que √© a Acelera 360, que √© uma escola onde eu ajudo pessoas a empreender com intelig√™ncia artificial, com tecnologia. Ent√£o assim, eu tenho muita propriedade para falar nisso. Eu vou trazer alguns fatos relevantes aqui para voc√™, para que voc√™ entenda o meu ponto de vista. Primeiro ponto, a evolu√ß√£o da intelig√™ncia artificial. A I t√° evoluindo numa velocidade t√£o grande, mas t√£o grande, que eu diria que nos pr√≥ximos 6 meses essas grandes empresas que inclusive desenvolveram ferramentas de automa√ß√£o, v√£o desenvolver um modelo onde √© poss√≠vel criar qualquer tipo de automa√ß√£o atrav√©s de linguagem natural, como se voc√™ atrav√©s do prompt. Ent√£o, pessoas que se especializarem em escrever bons prompts v√£o conseguir criar qualquer tipo de automa√ß√£o. Recadinho r√°pido para voc√™ que t√° assistindo meu v√≠deo. No dia 4/10 eu vou te mostrar no meu workshop que vai acontecer online como voc√™ pode empreender com intelig√™ncia artificial. Ent√£o, mesmo que voc√™ n√£o seja t√©cnico, mesmo que voc√™ n√£o entenda nada de programa√ß√£o, mesmo que voc√™ n√£o saiba nem mexer no N8N, no make, em agente, n√£o importa. Eu quero que voc√™ esteja l√° comigo no dia 4/10, porque eu vou te mostrar uma infraestrutura de crescimento com intelig√™ncia artificial. Voc√™ vai clicar no link que t√° aqui na descri√ß√£o desse v√≠deo e vai garantir a sua vaga, porque s√£o 200 vagas e eu j√° vendi mais de 170. Ent√£o n√£o perca, t√° terminando j√°, hein? Te vejo l√°. Entendam uma coisa, a barreira da tecnologia, a barreira tecnol√≥gica de programar, de codificar, de desenvolver, ela est√° diminuindo a cada dia que passa. Do mesmo jeito que os programadores est√£o sendo amea√ßados, os automatizadores que atuam ali mais num meio que num low code, baixo c√≥digo para voc√™ que n√£o conhece, estar√£o cada vez ainda mais amea√ßados que o pr√≥prio programador. Ent√£o se pro programador vai ficar dif√≠cil, imagina para voc√™ que mexe no N8N, no Make, no organizando bloquinhos no CTRA e por a√≠ vai. Ent√£o, s√≥ isso j√° deixa para voc√™ um grande sinal de alerta, t√°, Kelvin? Quer dizer que eu n√£o preciso aprender sobre automa√ß√£o? N√£o, n√£o foi isso que eu disse. Eu disse que voc√™ n√£o deve focar 100% em ser um automatizador, em ser um construtor de fluxo. O mercado t√° ficando saturado. Existe uma baixa barreira de entrada para pessoas que querem se tornar automatizadores, pessoas que querem construir automa√ß√µes. Ent√£o, por esse motivo, cara, t√° virando um Mar Vermelho. E quem t√° falando isso para voc√™ √© um cara que consegue vender, por exemplo, uma automa√ß√£o a R$ 40, R$ 50.000, entendeu? T√°, Kelvin, mas se voc√™ consegue vender tudo isso, por que que eu n√£o deveria focar em automa√ß√£o? Porque o B2B, o empres√°rio que me paga R$ 40, R$ 50.000 por uma automa√ß√£o, ele n√£o est√° comprando automa√ß√£o. A automa√ß√£o ela √© o meio, mas o que eu vendo √© o fim. Ent√£o, por isso eu quero que voc√™ entenda que voc√™ deve desenvolver outras habilidades, focar em desenvolver outras habilidades que sim v√£o fazer voc√™ ter mais sucesso em 2026 do que voc√™ ser um excepcional, um ex√≠mio automatizador. Assim como hoje n√£o faz mais sentido voc√™ ser um programador muito um especialista em tudo, n√£o faz sentido voc√™ ser um automatizador muito Voc√™ pode desenvolver outras habilidades que vai fazer voc√™ ganhar muito mais dinheiro do que necessariamente a automa√ß√£o. E √© sobre isso que n√≥s vamos falar aqui nesse v√≠deo. No final das contas, a gente vai falar sobre como voc√™ vai fazer mais dinheiro, t√°? Passando aqui de novo para perguntar se voc√™ j√° comprou, j√° garantiu essa vaga do meu workshop. N√£o. Clica aqui, √≥. T√° no link na descri√ß√£o desse v√≠deo. Bora, vamos empreender com >> primeiro passo. √â muito f√°cil as pessoas saberem criar fluxos de automa√ß√£o, mas saber o que automatizar e o que priorizar primeiro para ser automatizado, isso √© dif√≠cil. E para que voc√™ saiba o que √© automatizar e o que que pode ser automatizado, o ideal √© voc√™ entender mais de neg√≥cio, entender como uma empresa funciona, empreender, por exemplo, de n√£o n√£o de forma profunda, mas de forma detalhada sobre como funciona um processo de vendas, como funciona, por exemplo, um processo de entrega eh de nichos espec√≠ficos, como funciona um processo de p√≥s-vendas, um processo financeiro, como que funciona um processo de capta√ß√£o de lead, um processo de marketing. Se voc√™ tiver uma vis√£o de dessas √°reas, de um determinado nicho, voc√™ vai ser uma pessoa extremamente requisitada no mercado. Se voc√™ ent√£o entender do neg√≥cio e tamb√©m entender da automa√ß√£o, da programa√ß√£o, da l√≥gica, da l√≥gica de programa√ß√£o, da l√≥gica de desenvolvimento de software e da l√≥gica de neg√≥cio, voc√™ se torna uma pessoa altamente requisitada. E isso sim vai fazer voc√™ ganhar muito dinheiro. Porque, por exemplo, o cara que vou vou dar um um pequeno exemplo aqui. Eu peguei um cliente, o cliente ele √© um expert, esse cliente ele vende um produto digital e a gente fez um trabalho nele de recupera√ß√£o de carrinho. Que que √© recupera√ß√£o de carrinho? Entrava para ele 1000 leads por m√™s. Dos 1000 leads, ele fazia 5% de vendas daqueles leads. 95% ele n√£o vendia. Ent√£o o que que n√≥s constru√≠mos? Sim, com automa√ß√£o, com chatbot, com um monte de coisinha, com ferramenta, com CRM, por a√≠ vai. N√≥s constru√≠mos para ele uma m√°quina de recupera√ß√£o de carrinhos. O que que √© uma m√°quina de recupera√ß√£o de carrinhos? √â um CRM fazendo a gest√£o dos poss√≠veis leads. √â um fluxo de importa√ß√£o dos leads de um de algum determinado lugar para dentro dessa ferramenta, desse CRM. √© um processo onde a gente come√ßa a nutrir estes leads em um determinado momento do tempo com uma determinada narrativa, com uma determinada oferta e a√≠ no final √© o pit, a entrada em contato via liga√ß√£o ou a oferta. √â a oferta, chamar ele e falar: \"E a√≠ quer comprar?\" E depois a convers√£o. Nessa brincadeira, nessa brincadeira de 1000 leads, a gente conseguiu trazer para ele mais 5% de convers√£o. Sabe o que significa isso? A gente dobrou o faturamento dele. E a√≠ voc√™ pode pensar assim: \"Nossa, Kelvin, mas cara, como assim? Ele vendia s√≥ 5%.\" √â, √© assim que funciona. As pessoas elas ganham dinheiro, mas elas tamb√©m deixam muito dinheiro na mesa. Elas perdem, elas elas n√£o est√£o preocupadas em pegar esses dinheiros mais dif√≠ceis, n√©? Elas est√£o preocupadas em pegar os dinheiros mais f√°ceis, n√©? Todo mundo foca ali geralmente nas frutas baixas. Ent√£o, √†s vezes, at√© mesmo √†s vezes n√£o, a maioria das da das empresas tem processos que s√£o extremamente ineficientes. E esses processos eles se tornam cada vez mais ineficientes, at√© mesmo por conta das pessoas que est√£o l√° e por conta do processo operacional que as pr√≥prias empresas implementam. Ent√£o, √© muito dif√≠cil voc√™ encontrar uma empresa que para fazer uma revis√£o completa em seus processos. Ent√£o, a inefici√™ncia √© uma inefici√™ncia que t√° l√° desde antes at√© daquele profissional ter entrado, ter sido contratado, tudo mais e ningu√©m trata, √†s vezes ningu√©m nem sabe o motivo. Ent√£o, por isso que eu digo em v√°rios meus v√≠deos que √© muito importante pr, no caso, as pessoas que querem empreender, entender muito bem o nicho de atua√ß√£o, escolher um nicho de atua√ß√£o, porque a partir do momento que voc√™ entende o nicho de atua√ß√£o, voc√™ foca em o nicho, voc√™ come√ßa a entender as dores que aquele nicho tem, que as empresas daquele nicho t e a√≠ voc√™ meio que fala a l√≠ngua daquelas empresas e voc√™ consegue captar mais clientes. Mas voltando ao ponto aqui das automa√ß√µes, cara, faz muito mais sentido voc√™s gastarem energia estudando, vai coloca ali 20% do tempo de voc√™s estudando a parte t√©cnica e 80% estudando a parte de neg√≥cio do que voc√™s focarem em 100% da energia de voc√™s aprendendo a parte t√©cnica. T√¥ passando aqui de novo para perguntar se voc√™ j√° garantiu a sua vaga do workshop grow que vai acontecer no dia 4/10. N√£o clica no link aqui na descri√ß√£o desse v√≠deo, vai ser online, n√£o perca. √â mais barato que uma pizza, Estudando N8N, estudando make, estudando ser o melhor automatizador do mundo, ser o melhor construtor de agentes via N8N do mundo, construir os melhores chatbots e sabe, n√£o faz sentido. Faz muito mais sentido voc√™ focar energia em 20% na parte t√©cnica e 80% na parte de neg√≥cio, porque a parte de neg√≥cio √© a parte que vai fazer voc√™ fechar bons contratos. A parte de neg√≥cio √© realmente a parte que vai fazer voc√™ ganhar dinheiro, que voc√™ vai sair do zero. Ent√£o esse √© meu conselho para voc√™s. √â um v√≠deo r√°pido, √© uma opini√£o minha que eu decidi trazer aqui para voc√™s para poder ajudar voc√™s, porque o ano de 2025 j√° acabou, n√©? Valeu, rapaziada. Tchau.",

          "transcript": "Yes, I'm in a hotel again. I'm in Meta Connect, but I needed to bring you the news. The first story is the Meta Ray-B band glasses, which I've had for a long time. The demo video, which was leaked earlier this week, shows what the future of Meta Rayban glasses are going to look like. So, you'll be able to talk to your AI. Your AI will be able to see the world. It'll be able to hear the world, and it will be able to project things onto a clear screen that only you can see. It truly is incredible technology. Meta is definitely going allin on the glasses form factor, which makes a lot of sense given their history with ARVR and the Oculus. And if you've watched this channel at all, if you follow me on X, of course, Matthew Berman, you know that I'm more bearish on the glasses form factor. But it turns out a third of the world wears glasses on a daily basis. Now, I can't imagine a world in which I'm wearing glasses all day, every day, but maybe I'll be proven wrong. We'll see. Okay, next. Open AAI's reasoning model just accomplished superhuman intelligence. It got a perfect 12 out of 12 score during the 2025 ICPC World Finals. Listen to this. The ICPC World Finals, the premier collegiate programming competition where top university teams from around the world solve complex algorithmic problems. This would have placed it first among all human participants. They had a 5-hour time limit in which they had to solve all 12 problems. These are the most difficult coding problems in the world. We received the problems in the exact same PDF format as humans. And the reasoning system selected which answers to submit with no bespoke test time harness whatsoever. For 11 of the 12 problems, the system's first answer was correct. For the hardest problem, it succeeded on the ninth submission. Notably, the best human team achieved 11 of 12. So they competed with an ensemble of generalpurpose reasoning models and did not train a specific model for this competition. They had both GBT5 and an experimental reasoning model generating solutions. So there's maybe a new model coming. We'll see. And if you think this is just OpenAI tooting their own horn, listen to this. This is Scott Woo, CEO of Cognition. So insane you guys have no idea how hard this is. And for those of you who don't remember, Scott Woo is basically a math genius. He was competing in crazy difficult math competitions at a very early age. So if anybody is to say how incredibly difficult this is, it's him. And just to wrap it all up, Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI. We wrapped up this year's competition circuit with a full score on the ICPC after achieving sixth in IOI, a gold medal at the IMO, and second in the AT coder heristic contest. The core intelligence of these models are incredible. They are more than enough. We just need to build the scaffolding now. And next we have our first paper by Meta Super Intelligence Labs. In this paper, they optimize rag retrieval augmented generation. That is the system that allows AI to store information and to retrieve information from natural language documents. So give it all of your PDFs, give it all of your internal documentation from your company and it can easily pull that context out of all that documentation, put it in the context window and then answer any questions you have. So in this paper they make Rag faster by swapping most retrieved tokens for premputed and reusable chunk embeddings called refrag. This method improves its speed by 30x and fitting 16x longer contexts without accuracy loss. This is just another feather in the cap of building incredible scaffolding for these models. And speaking of scaffolding, tool calling is an incredible part of that. And Zapier, the sponsor of today's video, has over 8,000 tools that you can call. Let me tell you about them. We use Zapier for so many automations at my company. Let me show you how we take a news story and convert it into a fully formatted social media post. The first thing we do is create a new record in Asauna with just the URL of the news story and then it automatically creates a record in air table again all through Zapier. Then we have two paths in Zapier, one for X and one for Instagram. We use chat GPT to create a short headline based on the content of the article. Firecrawl to grab additional assets and information and banner bear to create the header image for the story. And it will also put text on that image very easily. And then we take all of that and we push it to Buffer for publishing. All of this saves us a tremendous amount of manual effort and it's all powered by AI orchestration by Zapier. This is just one of dozens of the different workflows that we use with Zapier. So if you want to try this out or other automations, it's super easy. I'll drop a link down below to Zapier. Check it out. Let them know I sent you by clicking the link. And thanks again to Zapier. Now back to the video. Next, AI chip builder Grock, GRQ, has secured $750 million in new funding at a postfunding valuation of $6.9 billion. The funding round is led by Disruptive and includes Black Rockck and Newberger Burman, unrelated to me. The company will use the funds to expand its data center capacity, including new locations this year and next, according to Jonathan Ross, CEO, who've I've interviewed in the past on this channel. And Grock plans to announce its first Asia-Pacific location this year. It seems like the overwhelming thirst for inference for tokens is unquenchable. Nvidia is selling everything they have. Gro is selling everything they have. Cerebrus is selling everything they have. And so all of these companies are just spending as much money as they can building out this AI infrastructure. And I'm here for it. I'm so excited for all of this buildout to happen. All right. Next in the rumor mill, it seems Gemini 3.0 O might be right around the corner. A keen eye by Liam breaking Gemini 3.0 Ultra spotted in Google's Gemini CLI repo committed 4 days ago. And take a look at this. Here it is in the repo. Model Gemini 3.0 Ultra. So, we'll see when we're actually going to get the model. Maybe it's going to show up as an anonymous model on LM Arena or somewhere else. And you know, I'm going to be testing it out. So definitely if you're not already subscribed, subscribe so you can see that when I drop it. He follows up with more on the Gemini 3.0 Ultra leak found in Google Gemini Gemini CLI main branch. Remember Gemini CLI is open source. Committed 91225. CLI prep means beta is near. I cannot wait. Next, there is a new state-of-the-art benchmark on the ARC prize for V1. 79.6% 6% at $842 per task and on V29.4% at $3040 per task. Custom submissions by Gerber 888 and Eric Pang. Both are open-source use Gro 4 and implement program synthesis outer loops with test time adaptation. If you're not familiar with what that is, drop a comment below and if you want me to explain it, just let me know. Now, the full blog post by Jeremy Berman, again, unrelated, weird that two times this has happened in a single video, but he explains how he was able to achieve it. And all of this is based on the kind of dream coder method, which basically as the model learns things, it stores what it's learned and then it's able to generalize from there. That is an overly simplistic way of explaining it. And of course, Elon Musk had to drop in and say something. He reposted with Grock 5 training starts in a few weeks which is great news to hear but what does Grock 5 actually mean? Is that just every time they do a major training run they have to iterate on the version number? I don't know. Next do you remember Google announced agentto agent? It was a protocol that allowed agents to communicate with each other. Now they have AP2 agent payment protocol. This allows two agents to transact with each other. So announcing agent payments protocol, an open shared protocol that provides a common language for secure compliant transactions between agents and merchants. So not only can the agents actually pay each other, but the agent can pay different merchants as well. AP2 can be used as an extension of the ADA protocol and MCP learn more about how it works. And as you can see here, they already have a ton of partners lined up. So your agent is going to be able to pay for these services soon enough. So I see Adobe, Accenture, One Password, Into it, Red Hat, Salesforce, Octa. These are the biggest of the big names on the internet right now. And next, we're starting to get glimpses into what FE Lee, also known as the godmother of AI, has been working on at World Labs. So check this out. This is a 3D fully generated environment that you can play with right now. I'll drop a link down below. Now, they still have a wait list to be able to generate your own worlds and all you have to do is load up a single image and it will generate an entire world based on that image. But again, it's still on weight list. So, get your name on the wait list if you're interested in trying it out. But just from that single image, as you can see here, it is a massive world that has been generated and you can traverse and navigate through that world to your heart's content. All the details are there. It is truly incredible. I cannot wait to see what they do with this technology. And next, Tongi Labs has launched Tong Yi Deep Research. According to the post, first fully open-source web agent to achieve performance on par with OpenAI's deep research with only 30 billion parameters and only three billion of them activated. It demonstrates state-of-the-art results, scoring 32.9 on humanity's last exam, 45.3 on browser comp, and 75 on the Xbench deep research benchmark. Let's take a look. So, here it is. Here's Deep Seek. We have Kimmy, I believe that is Gemini, Open AAI, and so on. And this is just performing so so well. Humanity's last exam, Gaia, Frame, Simple QA, Browser Comp. So, you can check out the benchmarks yourself. I'll drop a link down in the description below. And continuing our Tong Yi deep research agents capabilities are built upon a novel automated multi-stage data strategy designed to create vast and highquality agentic training data without relying on costly human annotation. This seems to be the trend of really being able to scale up. You have to remove the human from the loop in the training and the reinforcement learning steps. So, it's fully open source. You can download it right now and try it out. Again, I'll drop everything in the description below. And a quick thanks to Dell Technologies for sponsoring this portion of the video. Dell Technologies has a family of incredible laptops called the Dell Pro Max featuring Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell chips, which are portable AI workh horses. It comes in 14 and 16in screen sizes and up to 32 GB of GPU memory. Perfect for onthe-go AI workloads. Check them out. Link in the description below. All right, next in what seems like a no-brainer, Whimos are coming to SFO. That is San Francisco International Airport. Whimos I have fallen in love with. But one of the big problems is when you fly into SFO, you can't get them at the airport. So you're using an Uber and then in the city you can use Whimos. But now, according to the mayor of San Francisco, the airport has approved a pilot permit to begin autonomous rides. This roll out will happen in phases and we'll keep you updated every step of the way until anyone can request a Whimo ride right from SFO. And if you're in the San Francisco Bay area, you may have seen Whimo's competition Zuks, the company by Amazon, has been really going hard and testing their autonomous vehicle very futuristic all over San Francisco. And apparently GPT5 Codeex was much more popular than OpenAI ever thought. I feel like this is a recurring conversation we keep having. Every time OpenAI drops something, they're like, \"Oh, we didn't think it was going to be so popular.\" And well, why not? It's amazing. And so, it's much more popular, which means they actually had to slow it down. So, Alexander and Bericos, who runs Codeex at OpenAI, says, \"Demand for GBT5 codecs is higher than forecasted. We need to stand up more GPUs.\" In the meantime, Codex is running 2x slower than targets. Working on fixing this ASAP. Now, remember when we were talking about tokens? Remember when we're talking about infrastructure buildout? This is the reason we need it and we need it now. The infrastructure investment is not slowing down anytime soon. Every time a new product launches, people eat it up and that is only going to increase in velocity. All right, in the next story, I'm not sure how I feel about this. YouTube announced that they are rolling out the ability for creators to create YouTube shorts with AI. The V3 fast model is now going to be available in YouTube and so you can easily just generate clips and I feel a tsunami of AI slop coming to YouTube and so it's going to be interesting to see how Google handles this. Some of these AI videos that have been created with VO have gone absolutely viral on YouTube, on Instagram, on Tik Tok, but it's just once the novelty wears off, I suspect it's just going to be seen as slop. They're going viral now and people love them now because again it's novel, but at a certain point we're going to need taste. Somebody's going to need to create a great experience, a great video, a great song from all of the AI output. Next, Hunan announces Hunan 3D 3.0 featuring 3x higher precision, a higher geometric resolution, 3.6 billion voxal ultra HD modeling for stunning details. What does that actually mean? Well, you can create 3D models. Creates faces with lifelike facial contours and natural poses, creating truly realistic highfidelity models. Precisely interprets input images to reconstruct complex structures using a layer generation strategy and generates ultra clear professional-grade details with enhanced texture fidelity and alignment for immersive true toes visuals. So, if you are a designer, if you are a creator, go check this out. All right. And in another example of humanoid robots blowing my mind, look at this video. So, not only are we seeing the robot be abused by a human, but the speed at which it gets up off the ground is really stunning. So, it doesn't seem like we're that far away from really actually having a robot UFC type thing. And I just not a huge fan of kicking and punching all these robots, you know, just in case they can actually remember these things and become sentient in the future. So, that's it for today.

          "transcript": "I just built a nocode funnel in minutes and¬†\nit's faster and more powerful than a basic¬†¬† landing page. In this video, you're going to¬†\nsee exactly how I built it, what the tool is,¬†¬† and what are the powerful features that give you¬†\nthe ability to get more customers than just a¬†¬† basic landing page. Thank you to Perspective for¬†\nsponsoring this video. And if you stick around,¬†¬† I'm going to give you a link to get this free¬†\ntemplate on Perspective that you can use for¬†¬† your own business. So, I'm going to show you just¬†\nhow easy it is to build a really high quality and¬†¬† polished funnel with Perspective. And you can go¬†\nto Perspective with the link in the description¬†¬† to do this alongside with me. What's cool here¬†\nis Perspective isn't just another form builder.¬†¬† It's designed to qualify leads, score them, and¬†\nplug them straight into your automations. you can¬†¬† sign up for a free trial, so you don't have to pay¬†\nanything to actually build alongside with me and¬†¬† see if it works for your business. So, let's go¬†\nahead and click new funnel on the top right. And¬†¬† there's a lot of templates that we can start¬†\nwith. And there's also a blank if you want to¬†¬† start from a blank template. And in this case, I¬†\nalways like to do a blank template just when we're¬†¬† getting started because it helps make sure that¬†\nyou understand everything about the product. So,¬†¬† it's a blank template and we're going to be able¬†\nto customize it and I'm going to show you how it¬†¬† works. Just off the bat, I'm really impressed with¬†\nhow clean and nice the design of just the editor¬†¬† is. I really like that and I like the how just¬†\nlike by default the funnel looks really nice. So,¬†¬† let's say we want to make a funnel that is going¬†\nto just collect email addresses in exchange for¬†¬† a discount code just as an example. So, let's¬†\ngo ahead add the headline. Let's say get 50%¬†¬† off no code MBA. And I'm going to say enter¬†\nyour email to claiming or continue to claim.¬†¬† Really simple. And then you can see there's a¬†\nresults page as well that you can customize.¬†¬† And then we also can add in different elements¬†\nhere on the page. So, if I click new block,¬†¬† you can see all of the blocks that are available¬†\nhere in perspective. There's blocks that are more¬†¬† marketing blocks. You can add more information.¬†\nThen there's also interactive blocks which¬†¬† multiple choice quiz video things like that. So¬†\nI think I'm going to show you some templates that¬†¬† utilize more of these blocks in a second just¬†\nso you can see everything that's possible. But¬†¬† let's go ahead and say we want to add interactive¬†\nblock which is a form. So let's click on form and¬†¬† then just by default that's going to pop in.¬†\nI can delete the button that was there before.¬†¬† I can delete the divider. And then inside the form¬†\non the left side, you can change the design of the¬†¬† header. We have a tracking ID for the questions.¬†\nYou can also just change the spacing above and¬†¬† below it, which is really nice. And then for the¬†\ninputs, you can also change what we're asking for.¬†¬† So there's all sorts of basically preset things¬†\nthat you can ask for here in the form, which is¬†¬† great. And then we have email and phone number.¬†\nYou can also add inputs here by just clicking¬†¬† that button and you can delete inputs as well.¬†\nEvery element here ties back to outcomes. You¬†¬† launch in minute capture better data and instantly¬†\nsee where your leads drop off. So let's say we¬†¬† don't want a phone number. I can just go ahead and¬†\ndelete that. And then one more thing we need to do¬†¬† just make sure I have a second page here. I need¬†\nto delete that because we really only have one¬†¬† page here. And then it's going to the results. And¬†\nthen just to confirm, if we click on the button,¬†¬† you can go to next page or you can just by default¬†\npush it over to the results. I guess I'm not on¬†¬† the plan that can do that, but if you upgrade,¬†\nyou can go to specific pages dynamically. But in¬†¬† our case, it's fine because we're just going to¬†\nthe next page, which works completely fine. So,¬†¬† it's linking to the next page. So, let's go¬†\nahead and click publish. Our funnel is live.¬†¬† We can click preview to just view it in basically¬†\na perspective editor. And then you can share this¬†¬† with your team and leave comments. There's so¬†\nmany little touches that have been built into¬†¬† this product which I really like. Let's go ahead¬†\nenter in a name. We enter in an email. We'll click¬†¬† the button and proceed. And then we go to the¬†\nthank you page which is great. And let's say¬†¬† I want to leave a comment. Improve thank you¬†\npage. I can post that. And then that's there¬†¬† for someone else on my team to view and resolve.¬†\nSo that's the preview. And then if we publish it,¬†¬† we can now click. And then here we are on a live¬†\nview of this page. Cookie settings cuz it's GDRP¬†¬† compliant. And then we would be able to enter in¬†\nthe information in the exact same way. And then we¬†¬† can go over to metrics. We can see how many funnel¬†\nvisits we have, how many conversions, what's the¬†¬† conversion rate, pageto page conversion, device¬†\nsplit. Honestly, this is really cool. I could see¬†¬† myself using this for different lead funnels¬†\nthat I want to use with no code MBA or other¬†¬† businesses that I'm running. So, if we go over¬†\nto contacts, we can then see, okay, now we have¬†¬† a contact. But what's cool is it has a CRM that's¬†\nbuilt in. So, if you want to use this for sales,¬†¬† let's say you're a realer, for example, and you¬†\nhave a lead funnel. And then once you have leads¬†¬† come in, you can move them into different parts¬†\nof this funnel. You can also change the name of¬†¬† each of these steps. So, there's a lot of things¬†\nthat you can do here, which is pretty cool. Next,¬†¬† we have apps. So you can basically connect¬†\ndifferent apps to perspective. So first you¬†¬† have lead notifications which is that could be¬†\nreally important sending an email with available¬†¬† details when a lead is captured in a funnel. This¬†\nis something that you would need to upgrade to¬†¬† access. We also have make which allows you to¬†\nbasically connect your funnel in perspective to¬†¬† any third party. You don't need to upgrade if you¬†\nwant to just use something like make and connect¬†¬† it to make and then build your own automation. You¬†\nhave all of these other automations as well. Also¬†¬† through Zapier you have additional automations.¬†\nNow I'm going to show you some more template¬†¬† funnels in a second, but first I did promise I¬†\nwould share the link to get this template that¬†¬† Perspective made for us specifically for this¬†\nvideo. And you can see it's a lot more built out¬†¬† and polished than the one that we just created¬†\nto show you what's possible. So to do this,¬†¬† just click the link in the description, enter in¬†\nyour information. You'll get 30 days for free on¬†¬† perspective and you will also get access to that¬†\nlead magnet template that I just showed you. All¬†¬† right, so real quick before we move on, I just¬†\nwant to show you one more funnel, but this time¬†¬† we're going to do it from a template. So let's say¬†\nyou are a coach, you have a coaching offer. We're¬†¬† going to start with this template. And again,¬†\nonce you have your free trial, you can go in¬†¬† and test out all of these templates. So here we¬†\nare in this template. You can see it's a lot more¬†¬† built out. You can even add a video. It's just¬†\nreally polished. There is line items, list items.¬†¬† You can customize all of this. And then it's¬†\nbasically a full landing page that is built in¬†¬† as a funnel. So you can think of it almost like a¬†\nwebsite landing page. It doesn't just have to be a¬†¬† very simple form. This is why I like perspective.¬†\nInstead of building a landing page from scratch,¬†¬† I can take a template, customize it, and then be¬†\nlive in a few minutes. You can also go down to¬†¬† the bottom and view it as a desktop. So this¬†\nis what it looks like on mobile. Of course,¬†¬† a lot of people are going to go to your funnel on¬†\nmobile, but you can view it on desktop as well.¬†¬† So, when you're doing a more complicated funnel,¬†\nI definitely recommend using one of the templates¬†¬† because it's just so much easier, and you¬†\nbasically just have to enter in your information,¬†¬† and it's going to look really good right off the¬†\nbat. So, there's all these buttons. All of them¬†¬† are going to the next page. It's all going through¬†\nthe funnel. So, we can see once someone clicks¬†¬† that button, it goes on to this next page, which¬†\nbasically is going to prep the user to be ready¬†¬† to enter in more information. We have a quiz that¬†\nit's starting. We have a price range, position,¬†¬† budget. So, we're getting more information about¬†\nthe user as we go. There's an optin. This is all¬†¬† really cool. I really need to think about how¬†\nI can use this inside of note. And then there's¬†¬† thank you page. Really cool. And then a video as¬†\nwell. One thing that I didn't show you before is¬†¬† this messages tab, which as you can see it's in¬†\nbeta, but I do want to mention this. So here,¬†¬† when there's an appointment booked, when the¬†\ncontact status is new, we are sending an email.¬†¬† So you can build this out to basically have some¬†\nautomations to send an email to users when certain¬†¬† things happen. And of course, in this template,¬†\nyou can customize it fully, and when you're ready,¬†¬† you can publish it to your own account. Real¬†\nquick, let's just jump into one more cuz I was¬†¬† really impressed with the last one. So, let's say¬†\nwe want to do a webinar. So, let's start with this¬†¬† template, your webinar template. Webinars can be¬†\nused for just about any business. And here we go.¬†¬† We can see really cool how it just has this all¬†\nbuilt out. Once people would click on that link,¬†¬† we go to customization just to get some more¬†\ninformation about our users. And then to sign up,¬†¬† they would enter in their information and¬†\nthen at that point they would be signed up¬†¬† and then you would have their information¬†\nto then send them through automations like¬†¬† we talked about before. Send them an email. You¬†\ncan go into messages and by default we have this¬†¬† message sent. Hope you enjoy this overview. As¬†\na next step, click the link in the description,¬†¬† copy this free funnel and test perspective free¬†\nfor 30 days. We're building apps with AI or no¬†¬† code. The fastest way to get paying customers for¬†\nthose projects.

          "transcript": "DataButton lets you build AI apps that help you¬†\nwork 10 times faster and perform way better in¬†¬† your day-to-day. It's one of the few AI builders¬†\nout there that helps you create internal apps¬†¬† that actually helps you perform better in work.¬†\nWhether that's as an owner or as a marketing lead¬†¬† at your company, Databutton can help you create¬†\ncustom tools that you can use inside your own¬†¬† workflows. In this video, we're going to build a¬†\nmarketing dashboard with an AI churn detector to¬†¬† show you what's possible in databutton. Thank¬†\nyou so much to DataButton for sponsoring this¬†¬† video. I'm so excited to show you what is possible¬†\nwhen we build with databutton. So, here we are in¬†¬† the app builder. I've put our prompt in which¬†\ndescribes that we want to build a marketing¬†¬† dashboard with the churn detector. So, we're¬†\ngoing to hit continue here. We can upload more¬†¬† information about the app such as requirements,¬†\nuser stories. In our case, I'm going to skip this¬†¬† for now. We can always add more later. And then¬†\nfor design inspiration, I've just grabbed a really¬†¬† nice dashboard off of Dribble and we're going to¬†\nuse that as our design inspiration here. So, let's¬†¬† get started. So, here we are in our databutton¬†\ndashboard and we have five tasks that databutton¬†¬† created for us. It's already starting to work on¬†\nthe first task here. And then on the right side,¬†¬† you can see the agent is basically creating¬†\nsubtasks inside of each task and marking them¬†¬† off as it gets done. So that's something that's¬†\nnice about databutton is that it is going to be¬†¬† thinking through what it's building as it does¬†\nit. It's also going to help debug any issues¬†¬† automatically without you having to intervene.¬†\nNow what makes databutton nice for businesses¬†¬† is its ability to integrate with other services.¬†\nSo one example of that is the open AI integration¬†¬† we're going to add in. But you can also add in¬†\nother data sources. So in this app we're using¬†¬† dummy data just to show what's possible. But you¬†\ncould build an integration with something like¬†¬† Mix Panel, with something like Google Analytics to¬†\nbring in your real business data into databutton¬†¬† and then build apps around that. So we're going¬†\nto mark the first task as done. And then what it¬†¬† should do is automatically start working on our¬†\nsecond task. Now what you always can do is type¬†¬† messages and have a human in the loop to look at¬†\nwhat's happening. You can modify it, but in this¬†¬† case, we're just going to move on to the second¬†\ntask and continue building this out. you're going¬†¬† to want to stick around until task number four¬†\nto build out the open AI connection cuz I think¬†¬† that's going to be the coolest part of this build¬†\nis building in this additional functionality. The¬†¬† other thing that makes databutton nice for using¬†\nit in a business context is it's flexible enough¬†¬† for developers who understand all of the code and¬†\neverything behind the code and the database and¬†¬† what's happening. But it's also easy enough to use¬†\nfor someone non-technical to build with it or get¬†¬† something started and then pass it off to someone¬†\nmore technical. Okay, so we finished that task as¬†¬† well with setting up the database schema. You can¬†\nalso go to users and data here at the top and you¬†¬† can view and test this out. We have customers¬†\nand daily metrics. This is just some dummy data.¬†¬† Again, you can integrate with your own marketing¬†\ntools using data bug and ask the AI to do that¬†¬† to actually have your own data in here. But this¬†\nis the dummy data here in the database. And it's¬†¬† really cool that databutton can configure all of¬†\nthis for us. And if we go to the preview tab here,¬†¬† we can see the pages that it created already. We¬†\ncan see the components, UI, files, APIs, library.¬†¬† So everything here is accessible. You can see¬†\nboth the preview and you can also edit the code¬†¬† directly. So we finished this third task. So we¬†\ncan complete that. And now we're moving on to what¬†¬† I am most excited about is building the AI churn¬†\ndetector. And this is where we can really show¬†¬† off data buttons capabilities of integrating with¬†\nother services. So, it's asking if I have an API¬†¬† key. So, I'm going to say yes, I do have an API¬†\nkey for Open AAI. I'm curious. I think it should¬†¬† pop up here and ask me to enter it. Now I can go¬†\nover to my other screen, go to my OpenAI account,¬†¬† and if you don't have an OpenAI account, you can¬†\ncreate one for free, and then just go to the API¬†¬† keys tab, create a new secret key, and what I'm¬†\ngoing to do is just copy that in here. And this¬†¬† is basically like a password into your OpenAI¬†\naccount. That's how API keys work. So that way¬†¬† we can send messages to OpenAI and then get¬†\na response back. So I just saved it. And what¬†¬† also is nice about databutton is it saves them¬†\nsecurely. So, it puts it into the secrets so that¬†¬† your key isn't going to get leaked. So, let's go¬†\nahead and start the task. And what it's going to¬†¬† do now is start building out this AI functionality¬†\nfeature. I'm very curious to see what this ends up¬†¬† looking like. So, it says it completed this step¬†\nfive. What I'm going to do is test this out. So,¬†¬† I'm going to go to the preview tab on the top¬†\nleft. DataButton created this authentication¬†¬† component. So, the ability to sign in to our app.¬†\nSo, let's quickly create an account. And here I¬†¬† am inside of our dashboard and we can see it's¬†\npulling in the dummy data. So it's showing us¬†¬† customers MRR things like that. So we have this in¬†\nour dashboard and then if we go over to the churn¬†¬† detector and here we can see it looks like the¬†\nAI detection is happening. We have this loading¬†¬† indicator and in a second we're going to see back¬†\nwhat the AI model is saying. So it's been loading¬†¬† for a little while. What I'm going to do is send a¬†\nscreenshot of this to our agent and just ask it to¬†¬† verify if it's working. So this is where chatting¬†\nwith the agent can be really helpful. So what I'm¬†¬† asking is to add a button to start the churn¬†\ndetection, which I think is going to be helpful¬†¬† maybe in making this work, but also in helping¬†\nus debug it if it's not running again. All right,¬†¬† so now it is fixed. Something that might help¬†\nyou if you're debugging is just to tell the AI¬†¬† to review all of the code involved, which can help¬†\nit take a step back instead of just continuing to¬†¬† go down the same path that doesn't work. So this¬†\nis very cool. Now we have a list of our customers¬†¬† with a churn risk score and also a reason of why.¬†\nSo this says very low NPS and short tenure such as¬†¬† high churn risk. So a lot of it here is based¬†\non tenure and NPS. But of course this is only¬†¬† going to get better as we would add more data¬†\ninto it. So we have this AI churn detector now¬†¬† working. So I hope that you enjoyed this video¬†\nand are thinking about how you can use databutton¬†¬† for your own business. I can already see how¬†\nbuilding these AI features on top of our data¬†¬† like this churn detector or other features are¬†\ngoing to help bring much more power to this type¬†¬† of data than a spreadsheet or even other tools¬†\nlike Google Analytics. So, you're going to be¬†¬† able to customize your analysis on top of what you¬†\nalready have. Leave a comment below to let me know¬†¬† if this is something that you would use in the¬†\nfuture.
